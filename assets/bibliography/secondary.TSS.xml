<tss:note><title>Based on A.G. Ellis’s catalogue of the British ...</title><comment/><quotation>Based on A.G. Ellis’s catalogue of the British Library’s collection, Early Arabic Printed Books from the British Library includes examples from over 400 years of books printed in Arabic script as well as translations into European and Asian languages from the period. Together, they demonstrate Europe’s fascination, study, and assimilation of ideas and knowledge originating in the Arabic-speaking world, with its rich heritage of science, poetry, and Islamic texts. Scholars can search on the full text of items in Arabic, English, French, German, Latin, Italian, Dutch, and Spanish while also being able to discover content in Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Ottoman Turkish, Persian, Syriac, and seventeen other languages. Full-text searching capabilities created with newly developed optical character recognition software (OCR) for early Arabic printed script ensures that scholars in Arabic-speaking countries and those engaged in Arabic studies across the world can equally cross-search Arabic-language materials and research this extensive range of texts.</quotation><pages/></tss:note>

The first, EAP119, digitised the collection of historical periodicals in al-Aqṣá Mosque Library in Jerusalem (Al-Quds) in 2007.2 Two subsequent projects recorded manuscripts in al-Jazzār Mosque Library in Acre (ʿAkkā) (EAP399 in 2010) and al-Aqṣá Mosque Library in Jerusalem (EAP521 in 2012).3 After tracing a short history of the two libraries and outlining the development of the early Arabic press in Palestine, this contribution makes the case for the urgency of digitisation and provides a brief account of the digitisation process along with the challenges that the projects had to overcome. &lt;br&gt; </tss:characteristic>

Founded in 1922 by the Supreme Muslim Council in Palestine under the leadership of the mufti of Palestine, Hajj Amin al-Husseini, the library brought together the books that had been kept in al-Aqṣá and the Dome of the Rock buildings, and gradually also acquired books from private libraries in Jerusalem, in Palestine and even from abroad.</quotation><pages>379</pages></tss:note>

The initial output of the ATIZ BookDrive system is in RAW format, which required conversion to TIFF format for archiving purposes.50 The digitisation guidelines for the project assumed a use-neutral approach and are based on digital library standards, best practices, and general principles for building digital collections. The goal of the project was to build a repository of digital master files in TIFF format for archiving purposes and to provide derivative files in PDF format for current use. Digital, high-resolution (minimum 300 dpi) master files were created as a direct result of the scanning process. A consistent file naming convention was established in order to manage the project effectively.51 Derivative files in PDF format were created for access and are available for browsing and reading.</quotation><pages>403</pages></tss:note>

<tss:characteristic name="publicationTitle">Baku documents: union catalogue of Persian, Azerbaijani, Ottoman Turkish and Arabic serials and newspapers in the libraries of the Republic of Azerbaijan</tss:characteristic>
<tss:characteristic name="abstractText">During the late 19th century, Baku, the capital of the Republic of Azerbaijan, was an important centre for collecting information on neighbouring Muslim countries. This tradition was maintained under the Soviet administration, with the result that today libraries in Baku and Azerbaijan boast an extensive and unique collection of books, manuscripts, newspapers and other serials from the Persian- and Turkic-speaking areas of the Caucasus and Central Asia, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Ottoman Empire and the Arab world. The newspapers and serials held in these collections - largely in Ottoman, Azeri, Arabic, Persian, Uzbek and Urdu - include rare materials which until now have remained unknown to the majority of scholars working in the field of modern Middle Eastern history. This comprehensive catalogue provides information on newspapers in 16 languages and published between the 1870s and the early 1990s. It is a unique research tool for all specialists in the field.</tss:characteristic>

<tss:note><title>Jumhūr:  old-Ottoman name for European republics</title><comment/><quotation>-jumhur - was not of French authorship, but rather a centuries-old Turkish name for European republics. Initially an Arabic word, jumhur meant a gathering of people, a crowd, a public. The Ottomans employed it in both the sense of public and republic, applying it as an appellation to the Venetian, Ragusan and Dutch governments with whom they had dealt for a long time.</quotation><pages>826</pages></tss:note>

If the idea is long known, we may ask, why would it take a neologism to express it? Is not the need to append the adjective 'Islamic' to the noun 'republic' in itself an admission (if indirect) that the connexion between the two is not self-evident?</quotation><pages>834</pages></tss:note>

Here the concern is not with singular ideas, nor with a set of perceptions which evolved gradually within one civilization. Rather it is with a complete system of principles and practices that was discovered suddenly, examined cursorily, and imported in large parts from one culture to another. </quotation><pages>822</pages></tss:note>

At a later time its semantic spectrum was broadened and it came to denote republic, the actual form of government as well.</quotation><pages>829</pages></tss:note>

In the remaining part of this article I propose to explore the evolution of one such idea - the idea of 'republic', which was absent from Middle Eastern political experience until its recent importation into the area. </quotation><pages>823</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title>al-Jabartī: jamʿiyya instead of jumhūr for republic</title><comment/><quotation>A bd al-Rahman al-Jabarti, the most prominent Egyptian historian of the period, wrote but briefly and with undisguised scorn of' the (new) order they heretically contrived' (al-tartib alladhi ibtada' uhu). He defined the republic as jam 'iyya, literally association or society, for in this 'blameworthy innovation (bid'a) which they had fabricated ... they have neither head nor sultan with whom they would all agree '.16 Jabarti avoided using the names by which the French introduced their republic - mashyakhaa nd jumhur - except when citing French proclamations. </quotation><pages>827</pages></tss:note>

Studying an alien system of concepts in transition is doubly difficult.

It showed that even by the end of the nineteenth century 'republic' in the modern European sense was less than a fully clear idea in the Arab Middle East.</quotation><pages>828</pages></tss:note>

<tss:characteristic name="abstractText">Ayalon tries to provide an overview of the entire history of Arabic press, periodicals and journalism, which I think is too ambitious a goal. He provides some useful terminological clarifications and summarizes some of his points made on other occasions, namely the 3(4) obstacles for the early Arabic press: objections against printed Arabic, illiteracy, poverty, lack of interest&lt;br&gt;Sources: i.a. ḥadīqat al-akhbār&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately using ḥadīqat al-akhbār only from the 1858-68 area that is held by many libraries.</tss:characteristic>

<tss:characteristic name="abstractText">&lt;a href="sente:/BachBibliographie/Ayalon+1995"&gt;sente:/BachBibliographie/Ayalon+1995&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;50ff. The Private Press , 1882-1918&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the 1880s the centre of Arab journalism moved from Beirut to Cairo and Alexandria. Whereas 42 private papers were produced in Beirut, 627 periodicals were published in Egypt. This development was mainly due to the exodus of "Syrian" journalists from the harsh censorship of Abdülhamid II. (50) Though not reversed the trend was toned down after the YTR in 1908 (51).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1882: crushing of Urabi revolt and beginn of British rule (51).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- journals/monthlies&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;al-jinan&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;al-muqtataf&lt;/i&gt;, two of the exiled journals where the blueprint of non-political journals (53). - however, the &lt;i&gt;salname &lt;/i&gt; 1296/7 recorded &lt;i&gt;al-jinan&lt;/i&gt; as political.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;al-hilal&lt;/i&gt;: the publisher moved to Cairo in 1886. The monthly focused on the Arabic and Islamic heritage, "sociology, history, literature, and language" (54).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both, &lt;i&gt;al-hilal &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;al-muqtataf&lt;/i&gt;, soon some thousand copies each per edition, making them the leading journals of their time (54).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- newspapers&lt;br&gt;Most important &lt;i&gt;al-ahram&lt;/i&gt;, already daily before 1882 and backed by the French. Followed by &lt;i&gt;al-muqattam&lt;/i&gt; in 1889. The latter's publication was stipulated by the British as a move against &lt;i&gt;al-muqtataf&lt;/i&gt;, whose publisher Faris Nimr became the new editor of &lt;i&gt;al-muqattam&lt;/i&gt;, reaching soon an enormous audience (55-6). Both leading newspapers were published by Christian immigrants (57).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;press in the Levant&lt;br&gt;Beirut remains dominated by &lt;i&gt; lisan al-hal&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;hadiqat al-akhbar&lt;/i&gt; (both Christian), and &lt;i&gt;thamarat al-funun &lt;/i&gt; (Muslim). One important new newspaper that gained prominence as reliable news source was &lt;i&gt;al-a&lt;/i&gt;ḥ&lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt;ā&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt; (1891). (63)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Damascus and Aleppo only two private newspapers were published each: &lt;i&gt;dimashq&lt;/i&gt; (1878) and &lt;i&gt;al-sham&lt;/i&gt; (1896), and &lt;i&gt;al-shaba' &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;i'tidal&lt;/i&gt; (64)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;after 1908:&lt;br&gt;Explosion of press publications in the Fertile Crescent and the Arabian Peninsula: one new journal every 6 days until WW I (65). &lt;i&gt;al-muqtabas&lt;/i&gt; was the first Damascene daily published in 1909 by Muhammad Kurd Ali (66). Most of the new journals were qualitatively poor products of over-boarding supply facing a lack of demand and many perished as quickly as they had appeared (67).&lt;br&gt;The leading newspapers in Syria had circulations of 1.000-1.500 each, in Lebanon 2.000-3.000. (67) &lt;i&gt;lisan al-hal&lt;/i&gt; allegedly sold 3.500 copies daily in 1914 (68).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wartime:&lt;br&gt;Leading Egyptian papers ceased publication. &lt;i&gt;al-mu'ayyad&lt;/i&gt; in 1915, &lt;i&gt;al-jarida&lt;/i&gt; in October 1914, and &lt;i&gt;al-sha'b &lt;/i&gt;in Dec 1914. (69) &lt;i&gt;al-ahram&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;al-muqattam&lt;/i&gt; survived (70).&lt;br&gt;Several wartime propaganda papers were published by the government. &lt;i&gt;al-sharq&lt;/i&gt; from 1916 onwards in Damascus with the participation of Muhammad Kurd Ali and Shakib Arslan (71).</tss:characteristic>

<tss:note><title>legal requirements for opening a periodical</title><comment/><quotation>The requirements prescribed by the state for those wishing to join the field and start a newspaper were minimal. The Ottoman Press Law of 1865 stipulated only a minimum age of 30 and no criminal record, with no requirements at all in terms of education, training, or financial obligations. The Ottoman law of 1909 added the requirement that a newspaper owner be able to read and write in the language of his publication, while an amendment in March 1912 added further the demand of primary (seven years) education and a money deposit, designed to guarantee the owner's abiding by the censorship laws.</quotation><pages>217</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title>al-Muqtabas during the 1920s</title><comment>$$sources$$</comment><quotation>The press, through impassioned editorials, endeavored to stir public animosity against the foreigners, called upon the people to resist the mandatory government's attempts to divide and rule, and lashed out at Lebanese newspapers, which for reasons of their own showed sympathy for France. This effort was led by Muhammad Kurd 'Ali's celebrated al-Muqtabas during most of the 1920s, run at the time by his brother Ahmad. With the closure of the paper in 1928, its leadership role was assumed by al-Qabas, edited by Najib al-Rayyis, with his cousin Munir serving as senior columnist.</quotation><pages>84</pages></tss:note>

Writ-ten in the first person singular, it mirrored the owner's sentiments, including personal comments incorporated in his reportage and quar-rels with his personal enemies. In the summer of 1895, because of an illness that kept him confined to bed for a month (during which, he proudly noted, he carried on editing the paper), Sarkis was forced to leave Cairo for convalescence in Alexandria.

Sources depicting the phenomenon refer variously, and impressionistically, to a single issue being read "by 10 people," " b y an average of 5, and a maximum of 15, or more," "by 50 people," or "by 10, or scores or people."</quotation><pages>158</pages></tss:note>

<tss:note><title>Common traits of all journalists</title><comment/><quotation>Certain obvious traits were shared by Arab journalists despite the wide range in time and place covered by this study. Not coincidentally, these were also the traits that characterized the reading audience as well: Arab journalists came from the small, literate segment of society, a self-evident fact. The nature of the occupation and its indebtedness to Western inspiration made it likely, furthermore, that those involved in it were exposed, at least to some extent, to knowledge of the West and hence were prepared to engage in a nontraditional pursuit. They were overwhelmingly male, with a handful of women in the Egyptian and Lebanese press only. In addition, members of minority communities were represented in the vocation in proportions that greatly exceeded their ratio in society. They were prominent in the field not only in Lebanon, where the majority of journalists both before and after the formation of the republic were Christians, but also elsewhere.</quotation><pages>230-</pages></tss:note>

Yet, an evaluation of how readers assimilated and responded to written texts is essential to an understanding of the development of writing, religious or secular, literary or journalistic, for the readership influences the writer in many ways. This influence is particularly im-portant in periodical writing, which to a large extent depends on an ongoing dialogue, open or tacit, with the audience. Incomplete knowl-edge of the readers' side of this dialogue impedes our understanding of the development of the written medium.</quotation><pages>154</pages></tss:note>

Eco-nomically there was only limited room for large press institutions: a handful in Egypt — p e r h a p s half a dozen in the interwar years — t w o or three each in Syria and Lebanon, and one or two in Iraq and Palestine. "Journalism" in these larger enterprises meant something quite distinct from what it denoted in the old, more personal variation: A journalist was now a specialist within the system that produced the paper, rather than constituting the system itself.</quotation><pages>226</pages></tss:note>

<tss:note><title>Private press in Syria prior to 1908</title><comment/><quotation>The Damascus experience was similar. The official &lt;i&gt;Suriya &lt;/i&gt;was the only newspaper in the city for 13 years before the first private paper, the weekly &lt;i&gt;Dimashq, &lt;/i&gt;was issued in 1878 by Ahmad 'Izzat Basha al-'Abid. It appeared intermittently for nine years, then closed for economic reasons. Another nine years elapsed with only the official bulletin in circulation, when in 1896 another private journal appeared, Mustafa Wasifs &lt;i&gt;al-Sham &lt;/i&gt;(a name denoting the geographic entity of Syria), which lasted until 1908. Both of these private papers were published by men who simultaneously held positions as state officials — 'Abid was the editor of &lt;i&gt;Suriya &lt;/i&gt;as well as chief of intelligence in the provincial administration; Wasif headed the state press and the local fire brigade. Both were supported by the authorities and both advocated a line consonant with that of the government. Focusing mostly on local news, they dealt "with matters that do not enrich the mind nor do they inspire anything good," in the words of a contemporary reader, and could barely have been more exciting than their official counterpart, reflecting a sterile, or perhaps sterilized, intellectual spirit.49 Literary and scientific journals, which in Lebanon and Egypt had pioneered the emergence of the press, first appeared in the cities of Syria more than 20 years after the earliest political papers were founded. When they did emerge they were limited in number and frail: Only two came out in Damascus and one in Aleppo before 1908, and none lasted more than several months.50</quotation><pages>64</pages></tss:note>

<tss:characteristic name="abstractText"># author's abstract&lt;br&gt;The article focuses on Arabic publishing in the nahḍa. Khalīl Sarkīs was a popular in the late Ottoman Beirut and a contributor to the nahda, the Arab literary-cultural 'awakening' in the 19th century. The "Arab nahda" refers to the emergence of literary, linguistic and journalistic creativity through printing that happened in Arabic-provinces toward the latter years of the Ottoman period. Nahda is also used in political sense particularly in describing popular energy designed to achieve liberation, political freedom, and others.&lt;br&gt;# critique&lt;br&gt;Rather superficial account of the nahḍa and Khalīl Sarkīs and his printing press. Whenever some detail would be required, he refers to further necessary research.</tss:characteristic>

<tss:characteristic name="articleTitle">Arab Booksellers and Bookshops in the Age of Printing, 1850–1914</tss:characteristic>
<tss:characteristic name="publicationTitle">British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies</tss:characteristic>
<tss:characteristic name="abstractText">The emergence of massive printing in the Arab Middle East in the nineteenth century entailed a multiple set of changes. As well as the production of written texts in unprecedented quantities and the rise of a big reading public, that historic shift also gave birth to a range of diffusion channels-from bookshops to public libraries and from newspaper agents to reading clubs-which carried the printed works to their audiences. This article examines a small section of this scene: the growth, spreading and changing characteristics of book dealerships and bookshops in the Arab Ottoman provinces during the formative half-century prior to World War I. Exploring this mechanism casts light on the nature and pace of printing assimilation in the region, projecting it as a rather dramatic makeover.</tss:characteristic>

But Beirut was never a part of Mt. Lebanon and the political, if not social, context of publishing in the two administrative units was probably quite different.&lt;br&gt;    + this means "Lebanon" is basically limited to the Christian Jabal and the city of Beirut&lt;br&gt;    + Ayalon does not comment on the huge legal and political differences between the Arabic-speaking provinces of the Ottoman Empire proper and British Egypt after 1882. This is despite him recounting the standard narrative of Hamidian censorship and the intellectual flight to Egypt and the implications this would have when it comes to public reading and discussing news. He briefly mentions the latter point on page 183 and 190&lt;br&gt;- Change over time: in many aspects, Ayalon presents a static picture and quickly jumps between information based on sources from the 1870s to others from after WWI. He rarely traces development during his period of print revolution but focusses on changes between this period and earlier times.&lt;br&gt;- "publishing" and "printing" are often conflated; e.g. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &amp;gt;An important development borne by the state initiative was the birth, in the early or mid-1830s, of private printing in Egypt. Private individuals began to take advantage of the option offered by the Bulāq press, to print their own selected works under contract (*iltizām*) with it. (p.24)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    This seems to be an example of private publishing of printed material but not of private printing. However, Schwartz uses the same terminology (p.199ff)&lt;br&gt;- recounts the standard narratives&lt;br&gt;    + Hamidian censorship vs Young Turk liberty (pp.30--31, 66ff)&lt;br&gt;    + This doesn't fit the narrative on public reading of newspapers (178ff). Why would periodicals be subject to heavy censorship but public reading and discussions were tolerated without any limitations?

Often these works were printed for specific purposes, to serve a  group's learning sessions and ceremonies, increase its adhesion, or strengthen it against rival groups. As such they were sometimes intended for internal use rather than for open circulation. Sometimes -there is no telling how frequently -local shaykhs ordered a work to be printed in a limited number of copies for their brethren only, and these may not have reached any library.</quotation><pages>94</pages></tss:note>

It was there that group reading began and continued for a few decades before spreading to other provinces. There were several reasons for that. Until  1908, newspapers were scarce in the provinces beyond Egypt and  Lebanon. Copies of Egyptian and Lebanese journals  that reached other places came in small numbers and usually went straight to subscribers' homes and were read there. Lebanon itself, where papers did appear and circulate, was  -along with the rest of the  Fertile Crescent -under the grip of a suspicious government that was hounding the private press and spying on its readers in the marketplace and cafes. This apparently discouraged the handing of newspapers and discussing their contents in the open.</quotation><pages>190</pages></tss:note>

The town or village announ cer (munadf), usually a man with a thunderous  voice, would read out official or other announcements to crowds that would gather around him when he called for their attention.

Together they amounted to a far-reaching cultural transformation.

This was often the case when an author-publisher had a newspaper or journal as his pivotal project. Issuing a periodical entailed constant dealing with print ing, marketing, and vending, as well as continuous exchanges with read ers. In studies on the nah&amp;lt;f.a, this aspect of the work ofleading thinkers has usually been eclipsed by a discussion of their ideas and the public  dis course they evoked.</quotation><pages>37</pages></tss:note>

<tss:characteristic name="publicationTitle">International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media</tss:characteristic>
<tss:characteristic name="abstractText">&lt;br&gt;# author's abstract&lt;br&gt;Gephi is an open source software for graph and network analysis. It uses a 3D render engine to display large networks in real-time and to speed up the exploration. A flexible and multi-task architecture brings new possibilities to work with complex data sets and produce valuable visual results. We present several key features of Gephi in the context of interactive exploration and interpretation of networks. It provides easy and broad access to network data and allows for spatializing, filtering, navigating, manipulating and clustering. Finally, by presenting dynamic features of Gephi, we highlight key aspects of dynamic network visualization.</tss:characteristic>

<tss:characteristic name="articleTitle">The Longevity Of ‘Ephemera’: Library editions of nineteenth-century periodicals and newspapers</tss:characteristic>
<tss:characteristic name="publicationTitle">Media History</tss:characteristic>
<tss:characteristic name="abstractText">This is a great article summarising observations on the production, preservation and remediation of periodicals.&lt;br&gt;"library editions": are collections of periodical issues bound into volumes (either annually or bi-annually), discarding all sorts of "ephemeral" material, adding supplements, indexes etc. and thus producing a "volume", a codex that fits into middle class consumer culture, libraries etc. &lt;br&gt;it is these library editions that are commonly the only surviving artefact and the one that is digitised &lt;br&gt;# author's abstract&lt;br&gt;A combination of the practices of the printing industry and social institutions has ensured that some of the nineteenth-century press has survived, inviting us to re-think its status as ephemera, and to examine the history of its survival and the meaning of the formats in which it has been preserved. Most of the century’s newspapers and periodicals available today were bound into annual or semi-annual volumes, produced by publishers precisely for the preservation and purchase of single issues in a more durable format by individual and institutional collectors, for private consumption or public circulating libraries. This article questions the assertion that Victorian serials were among the larger category of Victorian ephemera designed to ‘flare and fade in cultural circulation’, and without aesthetic properties. Comparison of bound volumes of serials with individual issues identifies the material culture of both formats in this instance of re-mediation. </tss:characteristic>

The re-issue of Palmer’s electronically high-lighted its shortcomings, but it was an invaluable resource until very recently, when the searchable full text of The Times went online.</quotation><pages>17</pages></tss:note>

<tss:note><title>Multiple editions</title><comment> $$check source$$</comment><quotation>The constraints of the ephemeral are introduced and imposed by the date stamp as Margaret Beetham argued definitively in 1996 (Beetham, 10). A strategy of newspaper and periodical publishers to escape these restraints, and ephemerality itself, is to issue multiple editions that treat the date on the masthead as the centre but not the record of a cascading series of publications issued around that date, often not on it. Generically, newspapers*dailies and weeklies*are more prone than periodicals to publish multiple editions*during a single day in a fixed location, to accommodate the stream of news as it appeared 24/7; into the regions, for ‘country’ editions, often issued the previous day or earlier, to reach distant destinations by the morning sales period, to compete with local titles; or ‘colonial’ editions necessitated by geographical distribution internationally.</quotation><pages>12</pages></tss:note>

With covers and tables of contents of individual numbers stripped away, and the structure of individual issues obscured, it is often difficult to discern where monthly or weekly issues begin and end. But the index is the guide for the new larger unit*the volume rather than the issue.</quotation><pages>14</pages></tss:note>

This practice is often accompanied by the concomitant dismissal of serials and articles as ‘journalism’. However, as North alleges, historically serials numerically challenged books, and for that reason both the nineteenth-century book trade and editors had an interest in purveying the impression of the alleged ‘ephemerality’ of ‘numbers’*book publishers to contrast them with the ‘permanence’ of single editions of books, and serial producers to ensure that the last issue was abandoned when its more topical and news-rich successor was ‘ready’ for purchase.</quotation><pages>7</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title>The library edition</title><comment>This is an important point. Is this also the case for the Arabic press?</comment><quotation>However, most of the century’s newspapers and periodicals that are available today were bound into annual or semi-annual volumes, which were produced by publishers precisely for the preservation and purchase of single issues in a more durable format by individual and institutional collectors, for either private consumption or public circulating libraries. These are the ‘Library Editions’, the principal formats of longevity.</quotation><pages>8</pages></tss:note>

Hard enough to find in the vicinities of individual researchers worldwide, print runs of the nineteenth-century press are very likely to become in the near future even more rare. While a very small proportion of them have been digitised and will reach more researchers than extant print holdings, access to digital editions is also a problem, restricted as they often are to affiliation with rich libraries or consortia which alone can afford their high, aggregated purchase price.</quotation><pages>18</pages></tss:note>

The names of departments of a journal in the Index and their longevity in the period in question are instantly visible from some indices, as are the nineteenth-century categories of some content, the intellectual conceptualisation of which are alike of interest.</quotation><pages>11</pages></tss:note>

<tss:characteristic name="publicationTitle">Thamarāt al-Funūn, Syria's first Islamic newspaper, 1875-1908</tss:characteristic>
<tss:characteristic name="abstractText">Unlike his article on censorship, which confuses publication dates and calendars and, thus, mis-dates the issues of Thamarāt, the references in his PhD thesis are correct.&lt;br&gt;The focus of his work is on the early years, as on page 216 of some 350, he still writes on the early days of Hamdi's governorship (1880!)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Focus: the first 5-6 years of publication. The table of contents already signifies the focus of the thesis: the establishment and the first year of Thamarāt’s publication 1875, take up 34 pages (35-78), the following five years, 1876-80, take up another 102 pages (79-181), then follow some 113 pages for the almost two decades between 1880-98 (182-295), of which the first 40 pages are dedicated to 1880-81, after which Cioeta jumps to the late 1880s and then to 1896 in a shift from chronologic depiction to topic based snippets. In addition, he repeatedly returns to the 1880s (e.g. 278). The final decade, 1898-1908, is treated within less than 40 pages (296-332). Altogether this set-up dedicates more than half of the thesis to the first 5-6 of 33 years of publication, without ever commenting on or explaining this choice. This is particularly worrying as the changes in the legal framework of 1894 or the split of Beirut from Damascus as an independent province in 1888, might have impacts that are not really discussed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Methodology: narrative description along the almost sole source of Thamarāt itself, always identifying the paper and its articles with the editors, ʿAbd al-Qādir al-Qabbānī and later Aḥmad Ḥasan Ṭabbāra. Over long stretches, the thesis reads like an intellectual biography of al-Qabbānī.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Critique: all the controversies with other papers or the authorities are solely reported through Thamarāt’s articles, without commenting on this limitation and bias. This is specifically unfortunate, as at least the most audible opponent, al-Bashīr, is readily available. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Content and Focus:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;107-121controversy between Thamarāt and al-Ahrām, resulting in the ban of al-Ahrām 1877. advent of censorship under Khalīl al-Khūrī&lt;br&gt;125-129al-Qabbānī influencing the elections for the municipality in Beirut in 1878.

He managed to get his candidates through and started to influence the agenda of the council: increasing revenues for reforms (129)&lt;br&gt;130-140Focus on education of Syrian Muslims, which had been the original aim of the Jamʿiyyat al-Funūn. establishing the Jamʿiyyat al-Maqāṣid al-Khayriyya in 1878 in Qabbānī’s house (135ff). Thamarāt becomes the newsletter of the society, and Q its president, but never intertwining the administration of the two (137). The society also rallied for the appointment of local officials to local offices to limit corruption (140). &lt;br&gt;141-150Support for and of Midḥat Pasha. society paid for the reception in Beirut (144). Thamarāt pointing out cases of misconduct to be followed up by Midḥat (146f), who was not so enthusiastically received in Damascus, as he was portrayed as the candidate of the British FO (148).

III: 1880-1898&lt;br&gt;185advent of censorship in the wake of the Ottoman-Russian War. A warning not to publish false news was issued and Lisān was the first paper to be suspended under the terms thereof in Dec 1880(186). In Sep 1881, a series of decrees was issued against Bashīr, Taqaddum, Miṣbāḥ and established certain guidelines [correct titles seem to have been particularly enforced]. Janna was the only paper to repeat offences. (187).&lt;br&gt;188-205Thamarāt’s fate under censorship. only once threatened with suspension.(188) But numerous controversies: 1. over a play at a school involving alcohol (189), 2. over Syrians in Egypt and the bombardment of Alexandria (194ff) in the course of which publishing news from Egypt was banned and Janna was suspended (198), and 3. with al-Jawāʾib in the course of which both papers were officially warned (199-205)&lt;br&gt;206corruption and complaints about corrupt officials, the latter usually caused an official investigation (211).&lt;br&gt;212-219education. repeatedly calling on the Muslims to send their children to school (214). RPE of 1880 being implemented an EC is established and the benevolent society was dissolved. Qabbānī is member of the EC(216). If discussing education during Ḥamdī Pasha’s governorship, Q confounded it to the meetings of the EC (219).&lt;br&gt;220one month’s suspension due to financial shortcomings&lt;br&gt;223-Ḥamdī’s sudden death in August 1885. This is a sudden jump from 1881/2, given that it took some 180 pages for 1875-1882.&lt;br&gt;225 1889: publishing economic news after Ḥamdī’s death. wow another leap&lt;br&gt;2271896: and another leap&lt;br&gt;224focus on economic issues. mainly dating to early 1880s, 1889 and 1896. rallying for economic patriotism and support for local textiles (232ff) and agriculture&lt;br&gt;235-48stance on railway and harbour concession. After opening the Damascus-Beirut line, Thamarāt received a lot of complaints (244) [particularly over the lack of gender segregation; see my PhD]. Effectively the railway had slowed down transport between the two cities and the Ottoman post soon reverted back to the coaches (245)&lt;br&gt;249Tobacco Regie. despite being opposed to tobacco, Q recognises its importance for the common people &lt;br&gt;251-255moral economy: hoarding and manipulated bread and firewood/ charcoal prices are an constant issue (well, not constant). after the 1892/3 winter, the municipality of Beirut fixed the prices for fuel (253). calling for iḥtisāb (254-5)&lt;br&gt;255education again. In 1894, Thamarāt successfully rallied for the payment of arrears to teachers (265). During a short period in 1896, Syrian students were expelled from al-Azhar and generally prohibited to enroll (270)&lt;br&gt;271defending Islam and Muslims. Against onslaught by i.a. al-Bashīr, claiming that pictures of Jesus and Mary were kept in the Kaʿba. Thamarāt caused them to be warned by the censors.

Thamarāt: useful training (284)&lt;br&gt;284the kite-flying issue of 1887: as papers were threatened with suspension for false news, they tried to carefully verify local news. Yet the contradicted in their reports on the kite-flying matter (284f)&lt;br&gt;286-288censorship: “inescapable part of publishing” (286). Khalīl al-Khūrī as providing a lenient and consistent supervision as a censor between 1875-1888 (287), after which the various mektupcus of Beirut, often not even literate in Arabic took over (287). 1888-1898, Thamarāt was warned twice and once suspended (288) [This data is not consistent with either my list or his own article of 1979].&lt;br&gt;293 Qabbānī’s era as editor: independent mind, as he funded the paper from his private wealth. With the election to the presidency of the municipality in Beirut, Ḥasan Ṭabbāra takes over as editor. (294f)&lt;br&gt;296ffCh V: Editorship of Ṭabbāra 1898-1908&lt;br&gt;2971898 relaunch: shift of focus from political news and essays – which should not compete with dailies etc. – to scientific and other useful knowledge (300ff). this was a huge success with the readers within a year. No complains of unpaid subscription fees in 1898 (305)&lt;br&gt;3071900 relaunch: further de-emphasising of political but also scientific news, “limited the  former to the  most  essential  information and the  latter to  topics with direct practical  relevance to  Syria.” (307)&lt;br&gt;309conflicts with the censor: publishing uncensored articles. Ṭabbāra’s “ defiance of the  law  brought his newspaper seven suspensions and  warnings  between  May, 1898 and November, 1904, culminating in an  indefinite  suspension that was tantamount to a ban on  Thamarat  al-Funun.” (309). Huge financial success (311) subscription peek in 1904 (323)&lt;br&gt;3131902: two events with long-lasting effects on Thamarāt. a) Qabbānī was not re-elected but appointed Director of Education in Beirut (314); b) a new Islamic newspaper, al-Iqbāl,  is set up in Beirut by Shaykh  ʿAbd al-Bāṣit al-Unsī and Shaykh Muḥammad al-Jisr with a simpler language and more conservative stance. (315-316).&lt;br&gt;316Short note on Iqbāl as being overlooked by students of the history of press, both Ṭarrāzī and Rifāʿī mentioned it en passant in footnotes. Yet it was published 1902-1929 by a prominent member of the Sharʿiyya court in beirut.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3241908, Young Turk Revolution. Return of journalistic freedom, informing the readers of the significance of the constitution etc. responsibility (325f). Ṭabbāra establishing his own daily paper al-Itiḥād al-ʿUthmānī (327) in consequence the 60 years old Qabbānī ended the publication of Thamarāt on 2 Nov 1908 (331f), after it had bridged two constitutional periods as a intellectual link between two generations of reformers (337).&lt;br&gt;339Qabbānī post 1908: engaged in various political activities, president of the Jamʿiyya al-ʿUthmānī, which soon became a political club (339), elected director of Awqāf. Died in retirement in 1935 (340)&lt;br&gt;341Ṭabbāra post 1908: becoming the most astute political commentator, publishing articles by leading reformers (341), in 1912 he changed the title to al-Iʾtilāf al-ʿUthmānī in support of the Hürriyet ve İtilâf Firkasi opposition to the CUP (342). The offices of this paper and al-Mufīd were raided and ransacked by the police, the editors arrested, and the publications suspended (344). In May 1916 Ṭabbāra was among those hanged in Beirut, aged 46. (349)</tss:characteristic>

<tss:characteristic name="publicationTitle">Islamic Reform: Politics and Social Change in Late Ottoman Syria</tss:characteristic>
<tss:characteristic name="abstractText">Commins' own abstract (p.4-5)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Among his sources is the journal al-Ḥaqāʾiq&lt;br&gt;"This study approaches religious reform in Damascus from the perspective of the social history of intellectuals: the experiences and outlooks of groups of intellectuals, and their complex interactions with their social, political, and economic contexts. In setting out the context of Islamic reform, I start with a description of Damascene ulama's place in society and of stratification within the ulama corps. The central historical developments in nineteenth-century Syria and their impact on the ulama complete our picture of the general context from which advocates of religious reform emerged. Moving to a more specific level, I discuss intellectual trends in the wider Muslim world that may have fostered religious reform in Damascus. Then I narrow the focus further with a close examination of the social origins of the reformist ulama faction in Damascus.&lt;br&gt;having established the contexts of religious reform, I turn to the initial emergence of the reformist circle and the reaction of conservative ulama against it, in particular their inciting Ottoman officials to persecute the reformers and thereby silence them. This informal censorship stifled the salafis in Damascus, and they reached out to sympathetic minds by corresponding with reformers in Egypt, Beirut, Iraq, and Morocco, constructing a network of contacts in Arab urban centers. To understand why the reformers so offended most ulama requires  an analysis of the salafis' distinctive ideas, especially their critique of practices and beliefs then prevalent among the ulama and Muslims in general. The antisalafi reaction also demands an investigation of the conservative ulama's social identity and their defense of their vision of Islam.&lt;br&gt;Finally, I probe the relationship between the salafis and other reformist groups in Damascus: the Young Turks and Arabists. The manifold social and political ties between the salafi ulama and the much younger, secular educated Arabists deserve close scrutiny because of the tension between Islam and nationalism as poles of political identity, a tension that is a recurring theme of twentieth-century history in the Arab world."</tss:characteristic>

The Umayyad mosque's preacher, Shaykh Hasan al-Ustuwani, gave a Friday sermon in which he censured the performance. Al-Haqa'iq published several articles and letters by ulama who proclaimed that Islam forbids theatrical performances. Most of the ulama justified their ruling on the grounds that plays contain slander, lies, satire, and effeminate behavior by boys, in essence equating the fictional depiction of characters with intentional lies. One of the articles against theater named 'Abd al-Razzaq al-Bitar, Jamal al-Din al-Qasimi, and four other ulama who attended the play, and insinuated that these men had to account for their tacit endorsement of theater.</quotation><pages>122</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title>1896/7 discontent among soldiers</title><comment>Commins references FO 195/1940 and 195/1984 </comment><quotation>In Damascus, though, the Young Turks continued their activities until July 1897. The clandestine group drew support from soldiers frustrated by arrears in their pay and a protracted campaign against the Druzes. Discontent in the military surfaced in September 1896, when a Turkish lieutenant interrupted a theater performance to deliver a speech denouncing the sultan, and officers in the audience prevented the police from arresting the lieutenant. The following March, the British consul reported discontent among the troops and rebellious talk among officers upset at the long delay in their pay. In July 1897, an official inquiry into the Young Turks' activities resulted in the expulsion from Damascus of 18 Egyptians who allegedly had ties with the Young Turks, the exile of the director of the Tobacco Regie, and the recall of governor Hasan Rafiq Pasha. That Young Turk activities increased after Hasan Pasha's arrival in Damascus and then subsided after his recall suggests that he countenanced, if not encouraged, them.</quotation><pages>94</pages></tss:note>

<tss:note><title>goal of research</title><comment/><quotation>This study approaches relogious reform in Damascus from the perspective of the social history of intellectuals: the experiences and outlooks of groups of intellectuals, and their complex interactions with their social, political, and economic contexts. In setting out the context of Islamic reform, I start with a description of Damascene ulama's place in society and of stratification within the ulama corps. The central historical developments in nineteenth-century Syria and their impact on the ulama complete our picture of the general context from which advocates of religious reform emerged. Moving to a more specific level, I discuss intellectual trends in the wider Muslim world that may have fostered religious reform in Damascus. Then I narrow the focus further with a close examination of the social origins of the reformist ulama faction in Damascus.&lt;br&gt;having established the contexts of religious reform, I turn to the initial emergence of the reformist circle and the reaction of conservative ulama against it, in particular their inciting Ottoman officials to persecute the reformers and thereby silence them.

Bibliographic clues about the technical and so-cial processes behind its digitization are scattered among its interface, its constituent files—not all of which are available through CA’s public inter -face—and paratexts of the NDNP and related programs. </quotation><pages>214</pages></tss:note>

<tss:characteristic name="publicationTitle">Historical Methods: A Journal of Quantitative and Interdisciplinary History</tss:characteristic>
<tss:characteristic name="abstractText"># authors' abstract&lt;br&gt;We have digitised a corpus of Italian newspapers published in 1873–1914 in Gorizia, the county town of an area in the North Adriatic at the crossroad of the Latin, Slavic and Germanic civilizations, then part of the Habsburg Empire and now divided between Italy and Slovenia. This new corpus (of 47,466 pages) is analysed along with a comparable set of local Slovenian newspapers, already digitised by the Slovenian National Library. This large and multilingual effort in digital humanities reveals the statistical traces of events and ideas that shaped a remarkable place and period. The emerging picture is one of rapid cultural, social and technological transformation, and of rising national awareness, combining the larger European pattern with uniquely local aspects.&lt;br&gt;# the corpus&lt;br&gt;- digital scans from microfilm&lt;br&gt;    + Italian: c. 45.500 pages&lt;br&gt;    + Slovenian: &lt;br&gt;- annotated with publication dates&lt;br&gt;- OCR&lt;br&gt;    + Italian: Abbyy FineReader 12&lt;br&gt;- Structural mark-up&lt;br&gt;    + none!&lt;br&gt;    + page is the unit of analysis </tss:characteristic>

The standard solution to this problem is that of ‘stemming’ each word, removing the inflection and keeping a stable word stem, by means of a standardised procedure. We used the Snowball stem-mer for both languages9, which, for example, transforms the Italian words (parola, parole) into (parol) and the corresponding Slovenian words (beseda, besede) into (besed)10.</quotation><pages>145</pages></tss:note>

<tss:characteristic name="publicationTitle">Zur Ordnung des Staates: jungosmanische Intellektuelle und ihre Konzepte in der Zeitung Ḥürriyet (1868-1870)</tss:characteristic>
<tss:characteristic name="abstractText"># Review&lt;br&gt;Extremely boring German PhD thesis. The introduction does not provide a larger question / framework and her short methodological comments are mediocre at their best. I.e. She just states that she uses Habermas' concept of a public sphere without any explanations or further comment. The same goes for a hermeneutic approach inspired by Gadamer but doing what he explicitly had rejected (again without further comment).&lt;br&gt;Her main quest is for establishing individual authorship for articles published in the newspaper Hürriyet and for those authors' intentions.&lt;br&gt;Her knowledge of newer literature on the history of nationalism seems limited as her discussion is based on 1960s and 1970s texts. These are also the ones whom she tries to correct with her thesis.&lt;br&gt;# Sources&lt;br&gt;The 100 issues of the Ottoman weekly Ḥürriyet published in London between 1868 and 1870&lt;br&gt;# notes&lt;br&gt;* makes the implicit assumption that anonymous articles were written by the editor by stating that it isn't entirely clear if Ḍiyā Bey authored the final 36 issues all by himself (p.120)&lt;br&gt;* main question: establish authorship for unsigned articles in *Ḥürriyet* in order to understand different Young Ottoman positions regarding the *Ordnung des Staates*&lt;br&gt;* aim: establish a ground truth for Ḍiyā Bey and Nāmiq Kemāl&lt;br&gt;    - at least this is the *de facto* aim / result.&lt;br&gt;    - she does provide only a very limited discussion of anything beyond her corpus of 18 articles, whose authors are known (authorship being one of the main criteria for inclusion in thois corpus)&lt;br&gt;        + ch. 5.3 (pp.225-252): discusses four(!) articles&lt;br&gt;* methodology:&lt;br&gt;    - data base (pp.94--98): for ideas, events, persons&lt;br&gt;    - full-text transcriptions of articles: computational frequency counts (really?)&lt;br&gt;    - authorship detection (Ch.4, pp.105--135)&lt;br&gt;    - style as parameter of authorship (Ch.5.1, pp.135--149)&lt;br&gt;    - read the entire paper three times (p.97) in order to establish authorship&lt;br&gt;    - *stylistics* vs *stylometry*&lt;br&gt;        + style (diagram on p. 133, i.e brief summary of Ch. 4)&lt;br&gt;            * quantitative criteria&lt;br&gt;                - orthography&lt;br&gt;                - lexemes&lt;br&gt;                - grammar&lt;br&gt;                - text structure (?)&lt;br&gt;                - text form (Textgestaltung)&lt;br&gt;            * qualitative criteria&lt;br&gt;                - article beginning&lt;br&gt;                - article end&lt;br&gt;                - article structure&lt;br&gt;        1. orthography: frequency and consistency of spelling variants (which the author calles "errors")&lt;br&gt;        2. lexemes: frequency of "special" words, established by intutition as to which "specific" words are characteristic for an author&lt;br&gt;            - provides frequencies as x per 1000 words, y per 10000 words&lt;br&gt;        3. text structure: length of sentences, length of paragraphs, number of paragraphs per article&lt;br&gt;* corpus:&lt;br&gt;    - ground truth: transcription of 18 articles of known authors&lt;br&gt;        + problems:&lt;br&gt;            * very small&lt;br&gt;            * lack of summary statistics: how many words?&lt;br&gt;            * instead of aggregating all articles by a single author and then compute frequency tables, she looks for congruence between articles. But articles were most likely too short for significant results (c.f. Eder's 5000 word limit below which authorship detection is more of a gamble)&lt;br&gt;* *Ḥürriyet*:&lt;br&gt;    + published in London&lt;br&gt;    + 100 issues between 1868, 29 June, and 1870, 23 June&lt;br&gt;        * Czygan provides two article counts:&lt;br&gt;            - total: 388 articles&lt;br&gt;            - 247 long articles + 41 short articles: which translates to 288 articles&lt;br&gt;    + how was it printed?&lt;br&gt;        * Czygan refers to type setters throughout her work but Ḥürriyet could have easily been lithographed. The cover page of the journal is provided in facsimile  (p.78)&lt;br&gt;+ application of her methodology&lt;br&gt;    * article 1 (226-231): analyses style; quantitative and qualitative criteria&lt;br&gt;    * article 2 (231-236): analyses solely content and qualitative criteria&lt;br&gt;    * article 3 (236-243): analyses solely content and qualitative criteria&lt;br&gt;    * article 4 (243-251): analyses solely content and qualitative criteria&lt;br&gt;        - carries a byline: Ḍiyā Bey&lt;br&gt;        - at least in this case, she should have at least tested for the metrics she established and presented in chapters 3 and 4 </tss:characteristic>

<tss:characteristic name="abstractText">The article provides the French translation of the "loi relative à l'adoption du calendrier occidental" of 8 Shub 1332, published in Taḳvīm-i Veḳāʿi #2803, 10 Shub 1332 / 23 Feb 1917. Signed Mehmet V, Shakh al-Islām, MoI, MoJ, MoFA, MoE, MoPW, MoF, etc. (47)&lt;br&gt;Art 1: the OE will adopt the occidental calendar with Hijrī year-reckoning. 16 Shub 1332 will become 1 Mar 1333 (this is weird, the difference should only be 13 days as mentioned in Art 2)&lt;br&gt;Art 2:&lt;br&gt;Art 3:&lt;br&gt;Art 4: the fiscal year continues to run from Mar until Feb&lt;br&gt;Art 5: the council of ministers is charged with implementing this law.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Comments on earlier calendars (48ff)&lt;br&gt;- the sene-i maliye / fiscal calendar was introduced in 1205 aH (1791). all ministries began to employ the new calendars (49)&lt;br&gt;- the Hijrī calendar used 12 months, as did the sene-i maliye, which employed 9 of the Syrian names and 3 of the greco-latin names for months (49)&lt;br&gt; - the sene-i maliye follows the old Julian calendar and is 13 days behind Gregorian reckoning in the 20th century (49)&lt;br&gt;- to adjust mālī to Hijrī calendar, a sene-i siviş was introduced. whenever a full Hijrī year fits into a mālī year, the calendars are adjusted. this occurs every 33 years  (50-51), but a printing error generated the year 1288 M, which would have been omitted (51) and the rule was dropped (51).

<tss:characteristic name="publicationTitle">The well-protected domains: ideology and the legitimation of power in the Ottoman Empire, 1876-1909</tss:characteristic>
<tss:characteristic name="abstractText">In agreement with the constructivist school of the history of nationanilsm, Deringil displays eduaction as the main instrument of a mission civilisatrice that aimed at making peasants into Ottomans (93-4). Thus it conceived of a program of unification through a singular language taught to all subjects (99) and targetted strategic minority groups, such as the Shiʿis of Iraq. (99). Thus in 1894 teaching of Ottoman became compusory even for non-Muslim schools and the OE paid for the teachers (105) c.f. salname&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Competition:&lt;br&gt;1869 RPE: conceiving a system of inspectors for non-Muslim / non-government schools (105) &lt;br&gt;late 1880s/1890s: numerours attempts to close down non-state schools for the lack of an official permit [Art 129].

<tss:note><title>1884: Muslim missionaries to Syria</title><comment>With reference to BOA MV 96/1, 96/2, 12 Safer 1302/1 December 1884</comment><quotation>The enforcement of orthodoxy went together with conversion of heresy. Even elements who were nominally Muslim were not beyond the searching gaze of Istanbul. On 2 December 1884, the Council of Ministers, acting on the sultan's orders, arranged to send twenty religious teachers to the vilayet of Syria, to inculcate the 'true' Islam on to the local population. This was deemed necessary as the ' Islam of the local population, sedentary and nomad alike, consists of nothing more than something they inherited from their ancestors, indeed, their Islam does not go much beyond their having Islamic names.' It was necessary that such unthinking practice be replaced by 'a consciousness of the honour of being Muslim'. This would prevent them being 'duped by missionaries and Jesuits who set out to deceive them.' It had been determined by a special commission in Damascus that special teachers, familiar with the local vernaculars and customs should be sent out to travel with the nomads and bring them back to the true path, In settled areas schools and mosques would be established."</quotation><pages>76</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title>clock towers</title><comment/><quotation>The visual confirmation of the sultan's sovereignty took the form of his monogram (tugra) which appeared on all public works completed in his time. Clock towers erected all over Anatolia bearing the imperial coat of arms and other reminders of sultanic power became ubiquitous. Some of the clock towers were inaugurated in small Anatolian towns such as Nigde, Adana and Yozgad to commemorate the sultan's silver jubilee in 1901. Finkel has pointed out that 'specifically secular monumental architecture' represented by a clock tower highlighted the confrontation between Qur'anic time punctuated by the call to prayer from the minarets, and conversion to a new economic order 'founded on the conjoining of time to labour'.64 Thus, particularly in Anatolia and the Arab provinces, these buildings were intended as physical manifestations of the 'middle of the message' and served as markers of a new concept of time and power.</quotation><pages>29-30</pages></tss:note>

<tss:note><title>1907: food riot at the tribal school in Istanbul</title><comment/><quotation>The Tribal School lasted until 1907 when it was suddenly closed down, ostensibly because of a food riot among the students. One can only sur-mise that the student population was stirred up by something more serious than flies in their soup: nascent Arab nationalism perhaps, or the spread of Young Turk propaganda since the Young Turk 'Revolution' was to fol-low one year later.6</quotation><pages>104</pages></tss:note>

Simultaneously, I entered these items in the bibliographical data base Citavi, adding a content summary and translations of relevant terminology and  quotations.  As  Citavi  is  only  designed  for  bibliographical  reference management, it does not have the capabilities of a sophisticated data base, but it did enable me to assign multiple keywords to the registered items and thus, to produce qualitative categories of themes and content issues, language forms and mental concepts that seemed dominant in the newspaper.</quotation><pages>33</pages></tss:note>

The new freedom was limited as much  as  it  was  officially  celebrated,  and  this  also  applied  to  freedom of expression  despite of  the  lifting of  censorship.  Many  newspapers  were  shut down by the authorities when suspected to support the political opposition - and state censorship was sharp especially during internal crises of the regime in 1909, 1912, and 1913. The methods of the Young Turks were in this respect not less oppressive than the policy of Abdülhamid.</quotation><pages>46</pages></tss:note>

<tss:characteristic name="publicationTitle">Digital Scholarly Editing: Theories and Practices</tss:characteristic>
<tss:characteristic name="abstractText"> This volume  presents the state of the art in digital scholarly editing. Drawing  together the work of established and emerging researchers, it gives  pause at a crucial moment in the history of technology in order to offer  a sustained reflection on the practices involved in producing, editing  and reading digital scholarly editions—and the theories that underpin  them.      The unrelenting progress of computer  technology has changed the nature of textual scholarship at the most  fundamental level: the way editors and scholars work, the tools they use  to do such work and the research questions they attempt to answer have  all been affected. Each of the essays in Digital Scholarly Editing approaches  these changes with a different methodological consideration in mind.  Together, they make a compelling case for re-evaluating the foundation  of the discipline—one that tests its assertions against manuscripts and  printed works from across literary history, and the globe.       The sheer breadth of Digital Scholarly Editing,  along with its successful integration of theory and practice, help  redefine a rapidly-changing field, as its firm grounding and  future-looking ambit ensure the work will be an indispensable starting  point for further scholarship. This collection is essential reading for  editors, scholars, students and readers who are invested in the future  of textual scholarship and the digital humanities.       </tss:characteristic>

<tss:characteristic name="articleTitle">Mind your corpus: systematic errors in authorship attribution</tss:characteristic>
<tss:characteristic name="publicationTitle">Literary and Linguistic Computing</tss:characteristic>
<tss:characteristic name="abstractText"># author's abstract&lt;br&gt;In computational stylistics, any influence of unwanted noise—e.g. caused by an untidily prepared corpus—might lead to biased or false results. Relying on contaminated data is similar to using dirty test tubes in a laboratory: it inescapably means falling into systematic error. An important question is what degree of nonchalance is acceptable to obtain sufficiently reliable results. The present study attempts to verify the impact of unwanted noise in a series of experiments conducted on several corpora of English, German, Polish, Ancient Greek, and Latin prose texts. In 100 iterations, a given corpus was gradually damaged, and controlled tests for authorship were applied. The first experiment was designed to show the correlation between a dirty corpus and attribution accuracy. The second was aimed to test how disorder in word frequencies—produced by scribal and/or editorial modifications—affects the attribution abilities of particular corpora. The goal of the third experiment was to test how much ‘authorial’ data a given text needs to have to trace authorial fingerprint through a mass of external quotations. </tss:characteristic>

A few controlled tests for different sample lengths, languages, and genres are discussed and compared. Depending on the corpus used, the minimal sample length varied from 2,500 words (Latin prose) to 5,000 or so words (in most cases, including English, German, Polish, and Hungarian novels). Another observation is connected with the method of sampling: contrary to common sense, randomly excerpted ‘bags of words’ turned out to be much more effective than the classical solution, i.e. using original sequences of words (‘passages’) of desired size. Although the tests have been performed using the Delta method (&lt;b&gt;Burrows, J.F&lt;/b&gt;.

Despite significant differences in overall attributive success rate between particular methods and/or style markers, the minimal amount of textual data needed for reliable authorship attribution turned out to be method-independent. </tss:characteristic>

Provided that 8,000 words or so seem to be sufficient to perform a reliable attribution (see above), in the present approach the size of 8,192 words was chosen to combine sam-ples from shorter chunks. In 12 iterations, a number of word chunks, or n-grams, were randomly selected from each text and concatenated: 4,096 chunks of 2 words in length (2-grams), 2,048 word 4-grams, 1,024 chunks of 8 words, 512 chunks of 16 words, and so on, up to 2 chunks of 4,096 words.

One of the ways to avoid a possible bias is to swap randomly some texts between the ‘training’ and the ‘test’ set, and to rep-licate the classification stage.</quotation><pages>170</pages></tss:note>

<tss:characteristic name="articleTitle">Rolling stylometry</tss:characteristic>
<tss:characteristic name="publicationTitle">Digital Scholarship in the Humanities</tss:characteristic>
<tss:characteristic name="abstractText"># author's abstract&lt;br&gt;This article introduces a new stylometric method that combines supervised machine-learning classification with the idea of sequential analysis. Unlike standard procedures, aimed at assessing style differentiation between discrete text samples, the new method, supported with compact visualization, tries to look inside a text represented as a set of linearly sliced chunks, in order to test their stylistic consistency. Three flavors of the method have been introduced: (1) Rolling SVM, relying on the support vector machines (SVM) classifier, (2) Rolling NSC, based on the nearest shrunken centroids method, and (3) Rolling Delta, using the classic Burrowsian measure of similarity. The technique is primarily intended to assess mixed authorship; however, it can be also used as a magnifying glass to inspect works with unclear stylometric signal. To demonstrate its applicability, three different examples of collaborative work have been briefly discussed: (1) the 13th-century French allegorical poem &lt;i&gt;Roman de la Rose&lt;/i&gt; , (2) a 15th-century translation of the Bible into Polish known as &lt;i&gt;Queen Sophia’s Bible&lt;/i&gt; , and (3) &lt;i&gt;The Inheritors&lt;/i&gt; , a novel collaboratively written by Joseph Conrad and Ford Madox Ford in 1901.</tss:characteristic>

<tss:characteristic name="articleTitle">Visualization in stylometry: Cluster analysis using networks</tss:characteristic>
<tss:characteristic name="publicationTitle">Digital Scholarship in the Humanities</tss:characteristic>
<tss:characteristic name="abstractText"># author's abstract&lt;br&gt;The aim of this article is to discuss reliability issues of a few visual techniques used in stylometry, and to introduce a new method that enhances the explanatory power of visualization with a procedure of validation inspired by advanced statistical methods. A promising way of extending cluster analysis dendrograms with a self-validating procedure involves producing numerous particular ‘snapshots’, or dendrograms produced using different input parameters, and combining them all into the form of a consensus tree. Significantly better results, however, can be obtained using a new visualization technique, which combines the idea of nearest neighborhood derived from cluster analysis, the idea of hammering out a clustering consensus from bootstrap consensus trees, with the idea of mapping textual similarities onto a form of a network. Additionally, network analysis seems to be a good solution for large data sets. </tss:characteristic>

<tss:characteristic name="articleTitle">"Modernity", "Tradition", and the battleground of gender in early 20th-Century Damascus</tss:characteristic>
<tss:characteristic name="publicationTitle">Die Welt des Islams</tss:characteristic>
<tss:characteristic name="abstractText">The article presents half-cooked musings on the topics mentioned by the title. Its is based on Gelvin's reading of Ḥaqāʾiq's replies (3 articles) to 2 articles by al-Zahāwī published in Cairo on the "woman question" [this is the worst translation of an Arabic article title, I have ever seen]. Gelvin outlines Zahāwī's articles in broad detail, but the replies in al-Ḥaqāʾiq - the official subject of the article - are done with in passing without elaborating on their arguments beyond summary claims, or their connection to an alleged Damascene scene of mutadayyinūn fighting the mutafarnijūn. Gender is not the focus of this article, as it is only treated as the foil against which the alleged battle between the two factions, about whose members we are not informed, is elaborated.&lt;br&gt;It seems as if Gelvin was in the need to publish something, and so he did. Awful! &lt;br&gt;Use for my work: search for an editorial in Muqtabas 6 Jul 1911 (which he refers to for two different issues), and some numbers of Ḥaqāʾiq; Gelvin refers to Muqtabas 722, 6 Jul 1911, p.1 as calling for government regulation of prostitution.&lt;br&gt;WRONG ATTRIBUTION OF NEWSPAPERS: Gelvin is another of these scholars, who did not keep proper records. Even though Muqtabas 722 was indeed published on 6 July [Tam] 1911, it did not contain the article he refers to, at least not on its frontpage, as repeatedly claimed by Gelvin (15,16). After having read al-Ḥaqāʾiq, the issue becomes even weirder: Ḥaqāʾiq 1:12 of 28 Jun 1910 claims to reply to Muqtabas 722 of 6 Jul 1910! How should that be possible? And why did Gelvin not see this contradiction?&lt;br&gt;His references to al-Ḥaqāʾiq must be flawed</tss:characteristic>

<tss:note><title/><comment/><quotation>From this perspective, the anniversary of 1900 was a  success for Abdülhamid: foreign delegations from many countries came  to pay tribute to him. “The red Sultan,” writes a disillusioned contemporary, “could flatter himself of having brought the whole of Europe at  his feet.”</quotation><pages>186</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title>1900: 25th (sic) anniversary</title><comment>He notes that a study of the press would reveal whether there ever was a 24th anniversary. Yes there was. The counting of anniversaries was consistent</comment><quotation>the sultan chose to make September 1, 1900 the day of his “silver anniversary.” This anniversary was officially intended to celebrate the twentyfifth year of his accession; yet, curiously enough, it was celebrated on the  twenty-fourth anniversary, as Abdülhamid had ascended the throne on  September 1, 1876. Was this due to a mistake in calculation? Or was it a  deliberate manipulation? It is indeed the second assumption that is most  likely to be correct. </quotation><pages>185</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title/><comment/><quotation>As far as the timetables in the offices were  concerned, the Tanzimat state repeatedly attempted to regulate them; 5   however, the very repetition of the same rules shows how difficult it was  to bring regularity and punctuality to work.</quotation><pages>183</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title/><comment/><quotation>On the same day, another act that adopted once and for all time à la  franque was passed. It set the beginning of the day at midnight and used  the counting of hours from 1 to 24.</quotation><pages>192</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title>1840 onwards: official use of Mālī and Hijrī</title><comment/><quotation>After 1840, we see the generalization in the use of the malî  calendar for all administrative and state affairs. From that date onwards,  the two calendars (hicrî and malî) were used in parallel—the former in  the religious sphere, the latter for administrative purposes.</quotation><pages>182</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title/><comment/><quotation>In the end, the law of February 21, 1917 retained only the removal of  the lag of 13 days between the two calendar systems. 29  Accordingly, 13  days were skipped: 16 Şubat (February 16) 1332 became March 1, 1333,  corresponding to March 1 st  of the Gregorian year 1917.</quotation><pages>190</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title>national holiday / fete national</title><comment/><quotation>After the 1908 revolution, the question of the national holiday soon  imposed itself on the agenda. The Young Turks wanted to create new  symbols, symbols worthy for the state, which would replace the essentially dynastic and personal symbolic politics developed by Abdülhamid. </quotation><pages>187</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title/><comment/><quotation>The daily press played an important role in this  issue: most newspapers bore the dates of the various existing calendars.  Public buildings, in particular post offices, high schools, and even the  Ottoman Parliament now included two clocks side by side, showing the  time à la turque and à la franque. In the administration and by the railway and navigation companies, European time was increasingly used. As  in Prussia, the railways in the empire acted “like a big national clock.” </quotation><pages>190</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title>Two systems of hours</title><comment/><quotation>Public clocks  that gave the time à la franque were placed besides the muvakkithane,  the “time boxes” in the main mosques that told worshippers the time à  la turque. They thus had to inculcate in the Ottomans a new division of  time; they reminded the Muslims of the existence, next to the time of  the mosque, of the time of the state.</quotation><pages>184</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title>celebrations and commemorations</title><comment/><quotation>The Ottoman Empire was well-served in this regard: there were  dynastic holidays related to the imperial family (the birth of princes or  princesses, circumcisions, marriages), religious holidays (Muslim, Jewish, Orthodox, Gregorian, Catholic, and so on), and private holidays.</quotation><pages>184</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title/><comment/><quotation>More out of necessity than before, the Ottoman was  now in need of a watch, the prices of which had dropped considerably.  It is significant how, according to the probate inventories, a watch was  sometimes the only thing of value owned by the deceased, as if it were  the first luxury one could afford</quotation><pages>191</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title/><comment/><quotation>To take only the case of the Gregorian calendar,  while a number of countries in Catholic Europe had adopted it without  delay, this was not the case for countries with a Protestant tradition.  England and Sweden did not do so until the eighteenth century and, as  far as Christian Orthodox states were concerned, they decided to adopt  it much later: Bulgaria in 1912, and Russia not until after the Revolution of 1917. Russia adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1918, Greece in  1923. Among the countries outside Europe, Japan joined in 1873 and  China in 1912. </quotation><pages>194</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title/><comment/><quotation>a mass of publications related to  time had emerged: directories, almanacs, calendars, not to mention the  salname of the central government and the provinces that were filled  with chronological information and historical benchmarks.</quotation><pages>191</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title/><comment/><quotation>With the establishment of the Turkish Republic and the founding of  the Turkish state by Mustafa Kemal, the issue of time would once again  arise in a very different context. </quotation><pages>191</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title/><comment/><quotation>These reforms began in 1840, just after the start  of the Tanzimat, with the generalization of the“financial” (malî) calendar  of state affairs and administration, and came to an end under the Republic with the law of 1935 on national holidays and days off, which in fact  constituted one of the last reforms of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.</quotation><pages>181</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title>Islamising policies!</title><comment/><quotation>In sum, as part of a political caliphate that aimed to strengthen  the religious dimension of power and to re-sacralize the imperial role, the  sultan sought to“build on the symbolic value” of the Hegira calendar. </quotation><pages>183</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title>sultanic festivities: birthday, anniversary of accession</title><comment/><quotation>Inaugurated during the era of Mahmud II  (1808-1839), these holidays were celebrated with even greater splendor  under Abdülaziz (1861-1876), 16  who chose to follow the malî calendar  for these two holidays as a way of signifying that these were matters  directly concerning the state. Later on, for the sake of giving more space  and more splendor to the caliphate, Abdülhamid celebrated the anniversary of his birthday based on the hicrî calendar (the fifteenth day of the  month of Şaban) and that of his accession according to the malî calendar  , or September 1 st , in the Gregorian calendar). His successor, Mehmed V Reşad (1909-1918), re-established the two holidays  of his birthday and of his accession in accordance with the malî calendar,   and October 25 th , respectively. </quotation><pages>185</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title/><comment/><quotation>Consequently, the day following December 31, 1341 (1925) became January 1, 1926.</quotation><pages>191</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title/><comment/><quotation>The assembly decided in  favor of the restoration of the Constitution in July 1908, an event which,  according to some of its members, marked“the new beginning of the nation in the world of freedom,”“the time of revival” (teceddüd),“the return  to life,” and “the rebirth” (iade-i hayat) of the empire. In preference to the  date of July 11/24, the day when Abdülhamid had restored the constitution under threat, the assembly actually pronounced the holiday to be  held one day early, on July 10/23, the day when the Constitution had  been proclaimed in Macedonia. </quotation><pages>187</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title>1917 reforms</title><comment/><quotation>In early 1917, at the request of Talat Paşa, then grand vizier, the case was brought once again before the  chamber and the senate. 27  Three issues were then discussed: the timelag between the malî calendar (of the Julian type) and the Gregorian  calendar, which was then offset by 13 days, the setting of the start of  the year—January 1 st  or March 1 st , as was the case—and determining  the basis of the calendar (Hegira or Christian).</quotation><pages>189</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title/><comment/><quotation>An important development during the time of the Young Turks was  the Ottoman state’s participation in the International Conference of the  Hour in Paris in 1913, which decided on the creation of the International Office of Time in Paris and the adoption of the Greenwich Meridian  for the setting of universal time</quotation><pages>189</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title>Hours a la turca</title><comment>qqqUse for my thesis</comment><quotation>Besides the multiplicity of calendars, there existed two ways of counting  the hours in the day: the most widely used was the hour à la turque (alaturka or Turkish), obtained by setting the watch to 12 at sunset; at the  same time, the hour à la franque (alafranga or Frankish) was also used.</quotation><pages>182</pages></tss:note>

<tss:note><title>Cut these two paras</title><comment/><quotation>While the demonstrators by and large adhered to the idea of a “moral economy” and “just prices”,  intellectual commentators as well as merchants, millers, and bakers based their arguments on a market  economy, within which prices were settled through demand and supply.  In reaction to the 1913 events, Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī published a long editorial in his daily alMuqtabas on the conditions of life for the poor in the city and on the duties of the authorities. After  reminding his audience that the authorities’ legitimacy hinged on the provision of security, justice, and a  favourable environment to earning one’s livelihood, he detailed the development in prices and wages over  the last decade. He claimed that the work which sustained a livelihood was waged with Ps 3 in the past,  while today one had to earn at least Ps 10. This was due, he argued, to the market forces of supply and  demand. While agricultural production had grown, it did not match population growth. In addition, new  railways to the coast had eased exports to Europe, while the transport to Damascus inflicted inhibiting  costs upon the merchants and, in turn, on the common townspeople. Thus, he advised the authorities  against (sic) enforcing low prices in Damascus. This would only channel supplies away from the town and  force the merchants to quit their trade and thus escalate the crisis. Instead, they should prohibit exports,  lower transport costs from the Hawran to Damascus on the state-owned Ḥijāz railway, and lift import  duties on grain. 111  Al-Muqtabas continued to publish articles supporting this argument. Thus, for instance,  an article under the title ghilāʾ al-hājiyyāt observed a global trend of price rises as being caused by the  increasing demand. 112   </quotation><pages>368</pages></tss:note>

Yet, comparing the development of both squares, there emerged sharp contrasts between levels of urban integration and spatial politics. While Sahat al-Sur maintained its local organization and function, Sahat al-Burj became a regional traffic hub and a place of imperial and bourgeois ostentation. In this capacity, it was constantly compared to other ‘great squares’ in Europe and the Azbakiyya gardens in Cairo.</quotation><pages>255</pages></tss:note>

Occasional prison riots took days to subdue, even if they occurred inside the domineering imperial Grand Serail itself.⁶⁹When three months later 1,400 Ottoman soldiers returning from a military campaign in Yemen passed through Beirut and were kept in the bar-racks for a medical check up, they staged a mutiny for arrears in their pay in front of the Grand Serail.

They elected Mika ̄ il Ghabrı ̄l and Elias T. ra ̄d, both Greek Orthodox members of the Ottoman commercial court, who later became involved in the Beirut Reform Committee, one Ah.mad Abd al- A ̄ l and the company’s engineer Elie Qayka ̄nu ̄,¹⁰⁷ as their representatives to negotiate their demands. Their opening positions were a 50 per cent increase in salary, a thirteenth salary payment at the end of the year and a bi-annual adjustment for inﬂation of 10 per cent, cumulative ﬁfteen days holiday and rest days after night work, free medical care and continued payment three and a half months into the illness, payment of pensions identical to the railway workers,  job security granted by law, ten-hour working days with double salary for extra hours, night work, and on holidays, and a company loan scheme. After four days of strikes that left the city dark at night, the general director of the gas and electricity company was willing to enter into negotiations. In a meeting with workers’ representatives he offered a 20 per cent increase for those whose salary was below 201 piastres per month and conceded to those operating in the city on most other issues but refused to make concessions to those in production in the factory.</quotation><pages>109</pages></tss:note>

Dressed and addressed as efendis, their corporate attire—black tailcoat and skin-tight, tailor-made trousers, white dress shirt, stand-up collars, bow tie, and the obligatory ruby-red fez matched with a well-kept beard or trimmed moustache—produced an angular facial and regular bodily appearance that radiated distinctly modern knowledge and authority.</quotation><pages>62</pages></tss:note>

It is striking that in the old city itself there were no corps de garde posts—the nearest ones being on Sahat al-Sur and the port. As for the corps de garde post marked on Zuqaq al-Blat (later, Rue Maurice Barrés), close to the Grand Serail, it consisted of two two-storeyed wings with an extensive annex for stables, arranged so as to frame a rectangular courtyard with a well in its centre.⁶⁸Two more corps de garde posts were placed on the main arteries east and west along the tramway lines to Nahr Beirut and the lighthouse respectively. But the highest density of Ottoman corps de garde were found in the southern, low-class quarters of Sunni Basta, and Bashura, as well as the confessionally mixed quarters of Ras al-Naba , Museitbeh, and Mazra at al- Arab near the two southern tramway lines.</quotation><pages>208</pages></tss:note>

The entry of the verbal noun tamaddun from the root m-d-n (inhabit, settle, dwell), is defined as the process whereby ‘man is molded into people of cities (ahl al-mudun) by morals (akhla ̄q) and [the cities] move them [the people] from a state of barbarity and ignorance to a state of human sociality and refined learning’.</quotation><pages>227</pages></tss:note>

The fall of the Hamidian regime in 1908 paved the way for political bosses to mobilize the urban population through horizontal ties of consociation and  vertical ties of patronage on the one hand and through conﬂicting and overlapping ideologies of nationalism, provincialism, and Ottomanism on the other. Patronage relied less on physical coercion or access to state power alone, but crucially on the zaı ̄m’s ability to build a loyal electorate through a party, a movement, a welfare organization, or a community-based clientele. What also distinguished a zaı ̄m from other notables was the respect (ih. tira ̄m) attached to his role.

On the contrary, imperial educational reforms had a profound impact on the empire. Between 1876 and 1908 the education policies of the tanz. ı ̄ma ̄t were continued and systematized into a tighter hierarchy of  age levels and school types.⁴³ The Hamidian policy of mass education was designed to inculcate both loyalty to the state and a modern morality based on Islamic cultural referents.⁴⁴ In the Muslim schools of Zuqaq al-Blat, too, Islamic reformist teaching methods were applied to produce—in the best Lockean liberal arts tradition—virtuous, and able men in their distinct calling’ to operate the institutions of the modern Ottoman state.</quotation><pages>172</pages></tss:note>

From 1888 onwards, merchants and politicians up and down the Eastern Mediterranean coast had to travel to Beirut in order to make their representations and press their cases. On the fiscal level, most of the annual provincial revenues first went to the treasury in Beirut before being redistributed in the new dependencies. The creation of the province consolidated Beirut’s economic position through the political functions performed by a late Ottoman provincial capital. In Beirut, the administrative channels of the entire province converged. Here the developments of other cities were determined, and their planning controlled. But as Beirut began to shape its administrative periphery, its privileged position was also frequently challenged by neighbouring provincial authorities and inside the new dependencies.</quotation><pages>55</pages></tss:note>

On the contrary, public construction—literally as well as figuratively—cemented Ottomanism as a state ideology. Everyday life in fin de siècle Beirut was the space onto which Ottoman imperial rule and elite literary discourses projected modernizing norms and forms of social order. As such it emerged as a highly contested arena of the conflict between perceived, conceived, and lived spaces. Local literary elites and Ottoman authorities shared normative projections of law and order. Marginality was produced as the obstacle to temporal conceptions of linear progress, the creation of healthy and salubrious spaces as well as concerns over public security. The solution was not to tackle the roots of social inequality that led to marginalization in the first place, but rather spatial containment, physical suppression, and social stigmatization.</quotation><pages>266</pages></tss:note>

Translated to the late Ottoman context, I argue that the reform project of the modernizing state attempted to give the space of empire the appearance of a formal, rational, homogeneous order, hierarchized into different levels of geography and administration. At the same time, this abstract space of the modern Ottoman state also generated and contained internal conflicts, sectarian prejudice, and sources of social domination that lurked behind the very appearance of order.</quotation><pages>10-11</pages></tss:note>

Muṭrān was part of a merchant elite who moved between Beirut, Damascus, and Paris, and in Istanbul between the palace, the Ministry of Public Works, and the international Public Debt Administration. Once these individuals had bought the concession, they were free to sell it to foreign bidders, and Muṭrān quickly sold his concession to de Perthuis’s investment company for 600,000 French francs at some consider-able margin of profit. Under these conditions, the concession business soon developed into an ‘emerging market’ for Ottoman merchants with relatives in powerful government positions.</quotation><pages>90</pages></tss:note>

The distribution of these police stations had a profound impact on the location and opening hours of cinemas, cabarets, casinos, taverns, and alcohol shops. Policemen patrolled the streets to ensure that all the taverns and alcohol vending shops which mushroomed in the pericentral quarters of Minet al-Husn, Zaytuneh, and Sahat al-Burj between 1901 and the First World War were closed at sunset.</quotation><pages>208</pages></tss:note>

I argue that Beirut owed its initial ascendancy to its merchants’ subversive activities to undercut the monopoly system imposed by the rulers of Acre on the Levant.⁶ In contrast to this strategy, the second half of the century was marked by concerted local efforts to invite Ottoman state power to Beirut by upgrading the city to the status of a provincial capital.</quotation><pages>26</pages></tss:note>

<tss:characteristic name="abstractText">It seems as if Hermann had access to a collection of al-Shām (39). Interesting comments on the press and the persons involved (38-39). Muṣṭafā Wāṣif as the brother-in-law of Adīb Naẓmī. Kurd ʿAlī as the editor in chief of al-Shām between 1897 and 1900 during which time he supplied all articles to Wāṣif for self censorship. Further free-lancing contributors of al-Shām include Jamāl al-Dīn al-Qāsimī, Shaykh Zahrān, Muḥammad Rājib al-Bayṭār&lt;br&gt;- either Hermann makes mistakes in transcribing his sources etc. or Kurd ʿAlī is numerously mistaken when it comes to dates and names of persona (e.g. p.38). In the latter case his status as witness for events that occurred some 30 and more years prior to his accounts must be heavily doubted.</tss:characteristic>

Digitisation is therefore justifiable as a conservation directive however what of those volumes that are not chosen? Are we creating an alternative version of Victorian culture through so selective a gaze? Indeed, who is choosing these titles? There is a question of access, both of what material is available to digitise and also what it is perceived ‘the audience’ want. However, a further question is raised—who are ‘the audience’? What are these archives going to be used for? This article will examine the different forms of nineteenth-century periodical and newspaper archives that are available, how they are organised and who their perceived audience is, before going on to consider the pedagogical utility of such sites. How can we enhance students’ understanding of nineteenth-century culture by using these archives in our lecture theatres? And if we do, what are the implications for research in the future? </tss:characteristic>

This package allowed users to cross-search all Gale newspaper archives using a single interface, providing access to more than 400 years of content over 10 million pages of images. Enhanced search and reading facilities were created allowing users to read newspapers cover-to-cover in full screen as well as to save, bookmark and print results. The breadth of the scope for the project is certainly one that is beyond any institutionally funded project from within the academic community. However, once again its aims are undermined in that it is a subscription service.</quotation><pages>27</pages></tss:note>

Yet too often this is how they are presented digitally. Though the ‘re-mediation of historical newspapers in digital forms has not only awakened thousands of later readers to the nineteenth-century press’ as Laurel Brake argues, too many digital archives are geared for searching rather than browsing which affects reading practices and distorts an understanding of how the text was first produced and consumed.</quotation><pages>22</pages></tss:note>

Digitising up to 40 million newspaper pages, the project incorporated the 3 million pages that had been funded by the initial JISC project. The new site certainly acknowledges a more inclusive range of users beyond academia. Tapping into current fascination with genealogy studies, users are encouraged to look at ‘family notices’ and ‘obituaries’ as well as ‘news articles’.</quotation><pages>26</pages></tss:note>

This work stands to augment the study of literary history by drawing attention to the magnitude of poetry published in newspapers and by making the poetry more readily available for study, as well as to advance work on the use of digital images in facilitating discovery in digital libraries and other digitized collections. This paper describes the first stage of our work to identify poetic content in historic newspapers, the training of a machine learning classifier.</quotation><pages/></tss:note>

<tss:characteristic name="publicationTitle">Distant reading</tss:characteristic>
<tss:characteristic name="abstractText"># publisher's abstract&lt;br&gt;How does a literary historian end up thinking in terms of z-scores, principal component analysis, and clustering coefficients' The essays in Distant Reading led to a new and often contested paradigm of literary analysis. In presenting them here Franco Moretti reconstructs his intellectual trajectory, the theoretical influences over his work, and explores the polemics that have often developed around his positions. From the evolutionary model of "Modern European Literature," through the geo-cultural insights of "Conjectures of World Literature" and "Planet Hollywood," to the quantitative findings of "Style, inc." and the abstract patterns of "Network Theory, Plot Analysis," the book follows two decades of conceptual development, organizing them around the metaphor of "distant reading," that has come to define'well beyond the wildest expectations of its author'a growing field of unorthodox literary studies.&lt;br&gt;# summary&lt;br&gt;- collection of essays/ papers published elsewhere&lt;br&gt;# Network Theory, Plot Analysis (211-240)&lt;br&gt;- read: 2019-12-06 </tss:characteristic>

Media historians did things very differently in 2002. In the last decade, hundreds of historical newspapers and periodicals have been digitised and made available to researchers via online archives. Whilst the emergence of these resources has generated contrasting responses from historians, an increasing number of researchers are now embracing the new methodological possibilities created by keyword-searchable digital archives. As the first examples of this scholarship begin to appear on the horizon, this paper considers whether media history is on the cusp of a ‘digital turn’. It outlines the existing responses to digital methodologies, deconstructs digital newspapers in order to explore how they differ from their paper originals and uses case studies drawn from my own research into the late-Victorian transatlantic press to demonstrate how new methodologies might be applied.</tss:characteristic>

Unfortunately, this process of transformation is rarely shaped by academic researchers. Key decisions on the selection of an archive’s contents and the design of its interface are made by librarians, funding bodies and digitisation companies.</quotation><pages>65</pages></tss:note>

As a result, the methodological implications of digital archives*their ability to extend the boundaries of research and answer questions that were previously unanswerable*have remained frustratingly absent from the debate.</quotation><pages>62</pages></tss:note>

In order to develop robust methodological responses to digital archives, we need to understand how newspapers are changed by digitisation.

<tss:note><title>This solar financial year did vary in two ...</title><comment/><quotation>This solar financial year did vary in two respects from the Julian OS calendar. First, the Ottoman fiscal calendar began on the first of March, rather than the first of January (as explained in part II). Second, the millennian number was that of the Hijra era, rather than the Dominical. That is, the SM year's millennian was that of the current lunar (AH) year in which the SM year began. For example, the 1st of March of the Julian calendar year 1864 falls within the lunar year AH 1281. Therefore, the SM year starting on that same 1st of March was reckoned as SM 1281, to match the Hijra era. </quotation><pages>161</pages></tss:note>

Thus, the year SM 1319, which began on 1 March AD 1903 OS, was a leap year, as the extra day (February 29) occurred during that year (1 March 1903 to 29 February 1904), while it is AD 1904 which is leap year in AD usage (reckoned from 1 January 1904 to 31 December 1904). </quotation><pages>160</pages></tss:note>

The error having  been made public, however, it was decided not to correct it, but instead to  abandon the sivig correction entirely. As a result, SM 1288 (which began the  1st of March AD 1872 OS) no longer matched the lunar calendar, in which  it was the year AH 1289. The two calendars no longer synchronized. This  is the reason for devising SM/ad concordance tables, because the Hijra  year is no longer a practical guide for aligning the SM and AD calendars  after AD 1870.</quotation><pages>162</pages></tss:note>

By and large, the area he designed as the ‘Fertile Crescent’ was geographically coextensive with those parts of the Ottoman Empire that the Sykes–Picot agreement of 1916 had reserved for Great Britain and France. By 1916, when Ancient Times was published, the USA had not yet entered the First World War, and the King– Crane Commission had not yet submitted its famous report of 28 August 1919, recommending an American mandate for Asia Minor and Syria.</quotation><pages>2</pages></tss:note>

For many decades, the problems relating to this structural crisis were referred to as ‘The Eastern Question’ or La Question Orientale and attributed to an ‘East’ that was only in part considered Europe’s cultural ‘Other’: regions like Greece or Macedonia (and sometimes even Asia Minor and the Holy Land) were rather considered part of Europe’s classical heritage; and in 1855, after the Crimean War, even the Ottoman Empire became an official member of the European Concert. </quotation><pages>12</pages></tss:note>

<tss:note><title>Frequency of publication</title><comment>There were at least two double issues.</comment><quotation>*al-Muqtabas* appeared regularly at the beginning of every Arab month only when it was published in Cairo (between *Muharram* 1324 / Februrary 1906 and *Dhul-hijja* 1909). When it was removed to Damascus and because of frequent official harassment, it appeared irregularly and somewhat haphazardly. Although after 1909, as indeed before it, each volume contained twelve numbers, nevertheless publication of each separate issue did not necessarily occur on time at the start of every month of the Muslim calendar. Indeed the last issue to which a specific month was affixed was *Ramadan* 1327 / September 1909. After that Kurd 'Ali merely numbered his journal by year, volume and issue. Because of this feature reference to *al-Muqtabas* in this study will throughout follow its owner's method of enumeration.</quotation><pages>126</pages></tss:note>

<tss:characteristic name="publicationTitle">Damascus: Ottoman Modernity and Urban Transformation, 1808-1918</tss:characteristic>
<tss:characteristic name="abstractText">The book is for the most parts an English translation of Weber's German PhD thesis that was submitted in 2001 and published online in 2006. Some unidentified parts have been updated and extended. (11-3)  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Volume 1: &lt;br&gt;I. Introduction ---&lt;br&gt;  - very brief outline of theory, approaches, and sources. &lt;br&gt;  - rejecting Westernist essentialist notions of one modernity that was implemented in a top-down approach, Weber suggests applying the concept of an entangled history (17) to investigate how local actors "shaped their own urban space" (19) and how the townspeople "locally adopted and adapted" to the ideas of a globalised modernity they were confronted with. Thereby he rejects any essentialising claims and the manyfold attempts to read the particularities of the Damascene historical experience, which he perceives as only "one of many regional expressions of an entangled modernity" (21), as a normative model for "Islamic" or "Oriental" urban societies. In doing so he emphasises the self-referrence of actors as being "modern" as one of the main conditions of global modernity itself.&lt;br&gt;- main source is the architectural heritage of the city itself, which is contextualised through written sources, namely the Ottoman yearbooks for the province of Syria, newspapers, prosopographical and biographical literature, as well as local judicial and foreign diplomatic archives. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;II. Protagonists of Change: "Ottoman State and Damascene Society between 1808 and 1918"&lt;br&gt;- Very brief historical overview of the period covered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;III. Witness to change ---&lt;br&gt;IV. Aspects of the transformation ---&lt;br&gt;V. conclusions ----&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Volume 2: I. Appendices ---&lt;br&gt;II. Catalogue ---&lt;br&gt;III.

Why ", –" "assumed" is just wrong.&lt;br&gt;"the seven volumes"? not further qualified. He provides a table of construction works, which is based on 7 salnames between 1304 and 1310, but the attached note 654 refers to 10 volumes. </comment><quotation>Most Damascene &lt;i&gt;khān&lt;/i&gt;s show signs of reshaping in the late 19th centur. The catalogue (p. II:76 ff.) lists the most mportant alterations and conversions, – but we may assumed [sic!] they were much more numerous. The seven volumes of the Sālnāme record many such redevelopments, giving an impression of the structural changes that resulted from the functional changes here.</quotation><pages>217</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title>Important change in decoration around 1800</title><comment/><quotation>These decoration techniques are important to our discussion ofthe developments taking place in Damascene domestic culture, since changes in architectural decoration were primarily achieved through changes of technique. Consideration must be given to the interplay between colour-pastes and stone carvig, and between painted &lt;i&gt;boiseries&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;ʿajamī&lt;/i&gt;) and subsequent techniques of carving, stucco-work and murals.</quotation><pages>246</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title>broad concluding claim</title><comment/><quotation>As we have seen, the period of transition from the 18th to the 19th centuries [sic!] saw a change in the techniques and forms used for architectural decoration, one that paralleled but was not identical or contemporaneous with the preceding developments in Istanbul. Stone carving was combined with colour-pastes, and forms were developed which do not occur in other cities of the Ottoman Empire. New demands were placed on traditional workmanship and, in response, traditional techniques were either adapted or replaced by new ones. A good excample of this is landscape painting, It became fashionable in Istanbul in the mid-18th century, after which Damascenes introduced such paintings into their classical &lt;i&gt;ʿajamī&lt;/i&gt; wood panelling in the 1770s. A few decades later landscapes were painted directly on walls, a practice that supplanted &lt;i&gt;ʿajamī &lt;/i&gt;wood panelling. In this example the gradual adaption to the new requirements proved insufficient, and the resulting tension led to an abrupt break in lon established craftsmanship.</quotation><pages>271</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title>4 characteristics of central halls in Damascus</title><comment/><quotation>However, central hall houses have more in common than just the ground plan; raher, they appear to 'import' a complete residential style. Central hall houses brought a number of elements to many different parts of modern Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine/Israel for the first time: representational façades, red-tiled roofs, plaster with stencilled paintings on the inner walls, ceilings, and doors. Once integrated into local building traditions, the concept of the central hall was applied very flexibly.</quotation><pages>336</pages></tss:note>

At least 3,000 demonstrators gathered in the same place in October 1908 to protest against the Berlin Accord (including the annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina by Austria).560 A public call for a boycott of Austrian goods followed soon afterwards.561 In August 1909 a rally was organized at the same place to support the domestic textile industry, at which the demonstrators wore locally made garments.562&lt;br&gt;The events in 1908 are a turning-point in the perception of public space. Thereafter political organizations made regular use of the new public spaces as a stage for elections contests and mass protests. Thus, an essential aspect of political participation evolved under Ottoman rule, an aspect that would become decisive during the Fayṣāl period and the French Mandate.563</quotation><pages>166</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title>"Islamic City" is not reflected in the Damascus sūq</title><comment/><quotation>This survey of the Damascus &lt;i&gt;sūq&lt;/i&gt; serves to qualify a view widely held among experts on the urban phenomenon of the &lt;i&gt;sūq&lt;/i&gt; that a characteristic of the 'Islamic city' is its strict segregation of residential and commercial quarters. This view is untenable in the case of Damascus. As Fig. 186 clearly shows there are many private houses in the bazaar area, most of which can be dated to the 18th and 19th centuries. Case studies show that private houses and commercial buildings were planned and built together.</quotation><pages>205-6</pages></tss:note>

This tendency can be ssen in all the details. […]&lt;br&gt;One of the main principles of administrative, social and urban reform – the creation of a new order – appears to be reflected in domestic architecture.

<tss:note><title>Critique: Electric street lighting</title><comment>Critique: A German war-time source of 1918 should not be uncritically cited as the authoritative source on Muslim night-life in Damascus. Further, the structure of the paragraph is confusing, as the information on the contract interrupts the narrative on the later conflict.&lt;br&gt;The reference to FO 618/3 of 6 Feb 1913 is correct. The FO 618/3 file for 1914 does not contain a letter of 1 Apr 1914 or any letter concerning the tramways</comment><quotation>The network of electric steet-lamps is one element of a many-layered process of redeveloping and securing public spaces (cf. p. 163 ff.) This did not, however, lead to new practices in all spheres of public life. After nightfall, Damascenes generally chose not to turn night into day&lt;br&gt;"once the sun has lowered its fireball behind the towering heights of Jebel Kasiun, the streets begin to empty. Except during Ramadan, the Muslim knows no night-life." [Jildirim 17, 15 Jul 1918!!!]&lt;br&gt;Electric light was first of all public light, and only sporadically did electric power find its way into the residences of the upper classes. The cost of the lighting was high, wuite often leading to conflicts with the operating company. By 1913 the &lt;i&gt;baladiyya&lt;/i&gt; had accumulated a bill of OS£12,000, of which the company had only received OS£500. The city council refused to pay any more and tried to extract itself from the exorbitant contract. The foreign-owned company retaliated by immediately switching off the street lights, which caused violent protests. Some tramcars were damages and street-lamps smashed. The contract required payment of OS£3 per light per annum. The company proposed installing 2,500 lights for an annual total of OS£3,500. Following negotiations the power was restored, but the tramway had become a symbol of the dependency on foreigners and therefore the target of protests. Although the tramcars were running normally throughout the city, a campaign was started in al-Mīdān to set up a private omnibus service and local people collected OS£1,200. Here the public could only use the tram under the watchful eyes of two armed police officers.[FO 618-3, 6 Feb 1913, 1 Apr 1914] The dispute escalated again when fares were increased in 1917, resulting in a general boycott of the tramway. The company immediately stopped the turbines on the Barada.

Individual building units almost always differ from ideal types and many developments overlap. Nevertheless one can trace changing design principles of domestic architecture that apply to the more than 600 individual houses visited. Out of them we can draw some types that include forms which, over a given period of time, appear with greater frequency and are typical for house in this epoch. Characteristic developments are shown particularly clearly in some houses of the upper middle class and upper class on account of their lavish decoration and furnishings.</quotation><pages>230</pages></tss:note>

In the following I will present further evidence supporting this statement. With attention focused on the much better known &lt;i&gt;sūq&lt;/i&gt; of governor Midḥat Pasha, a complex built shortly after Sūq ʿAlī Bāshā, we often overlook the fact that it was the private initiative of an individual citizen [!] of Damascus that marks the beginning of the new bazaar streets.</quotation><pages>182</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title>dwellings of the poor</title><comment>The conclusion should be further scrutinised, however, it is misleading insofar, as Weber misreads households for actual houses. Even though almost no one lived outside a family household, I see no reason why more than one family household should not have share a single courtyard.</comment><quotation>The single-storey living qurters at the rear are often quite plain in design. They represent the most modest category of dwelling to be found in Damascus.840 The properties were presumably intended for the lower classes or, where better executed, for the lower middle class. Traditionally, poor families had accommodation in so-called &lt;i&gt;ḥawsh&lt;/i&gt;s, i.e. houses built for several families containing units that were grouped around a courtyard. They were mainly constructed in the periphery of the city and in the Ghūṭa. Tenants rented individual units. 841 Although such complexes are recorded in the relevant sources, I had great difficulty finding them in my survey of today's buildings.842 As a considerable number of Damascenes must have lacked the means to build their own home, no matter how modest, there would certainly have been arrangements for renting a single room, similar to the &lt;i&gt;ḥawsh&lt;/i&gt;, in simple houses; for example, in al-ʿAmāra al-Barrāniyya. Households in Damascus were almost exclusively organized around families. Okawara estimates that only 1.9% of the population lived in one-person households and 1.1% in households that were not family. We may therefore assume that even the smallest courtyard houses were family houses.843 </quotation><pages>360</pages></tss:note>

Of the first three newspapers in Damascus [now, he is back to pre-1908], two were government organs but many others were launched later. Between 1908 and 1916 alone, 37 newspapers of all shades of opinion were established. 958 As for printing facilities, we have evidence of printing works in Syria from the middle of the 19th century, and by the turn of the 20th century at least six printers were producing books, leaflets, newspapers and magazines.

Design principles in the 19th and early 20th centuries are much better analyzed by examining the buildings, streets and districts themselves. Adopting this approach, we shall analyze in detail the development of the city, its districts and streets.

Here, cultural adaptation did not mean adopting ideas from Istanbul and Europe wholesale but adapting them to local traditions, practices and needs [self evident claim as adaptation never means adoption]. New forms of public life also appeared in the bazaar of Damascus, but the introduction of shop-windows did not seduce Damascenes to go window-shopping at night [what about during the days?]. Sūq al-Ḥamīdiyya, the 'longest arcade in the world'. devolved directly from the building typology of the &lt;i&gt;sūq&lt;/i&gt; and was not, as, for instance Çiçek Pasajı in Istanbul, a more or less changed copy of European models.</quotation><pages>205</pages></tss:note>

With the exception of a few terraced courtyard houses, hardly any courtyard houses were built in the 1920s and 1930s; soon, they disappeared altogether from the repertory of Damascene architects. They did not fulfil the criteria for class distinction anymore as they had done in the 1860s/1870s, and they no longer matched the aspirations of Damascenes' modern domestic culture, regardless fo their social backgroud.

<tss:note><title>Considerably less effort has gone into the question ...</title><comment/><quotation>Considerably less effort has gone into the question of how the texts thus encoded will be published. There is no common model—indeed, there is not yet a credible theory—of reading in the digital age. It should also be noted that the interests of creators of the texts, which at the moment also determine how texts are disseminated, do not necessarily match—in fact most surely mismatch—the interests of those desiring to read the texts, be they scholars interested in studying and close reading of a primary text or casual readers in search of reading material. </quotation><pages>2</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title>The model proposed here does not rely on ...</title><comment/><quotation>The model proposed here does not rely on the continued existence of a central authority or the continued existence of a sophisticated infrastructure and is thus designed in a way similar to the Internet itself. It does however assume the existence of the Internet and the ability to communicate over the protocols it provides. It goes without saying, however, that if the infrastructure goes missing, not all of the functionality will be preserved, but at the very least, scholars already set up with the texts they are using will be able to continue to work with them. </quotation><pages>6</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title>There is, however, another precondition for this to ...</title><comment/><quotation>There is, however, another precondition for this to work, which is of a legal rather than a technical nature. In order for this to work, the cloning and copying mentioned above has to be not only technically possible, but also legal: the texts need to be made available under licensing terms that allow, or maybe even encourage, re-use in the way indicated here, which seems to me to be the precondition of any scholarly discourse involving digital text. </quotation><pages>11</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title>Even where this is made possible by the ...</title><comment/><quotation>Even where this is made possible by the publication itself, as in the case of the Mark Twain project, or can be achieved through third party tools like the "Awesome Highlighter" (http://www.awesomehighlighter.com/) or the Open Annotation Collaboration (http://www.openannotation.org/), it is highly doubtful whether all these tools, together with the supporting infrastructure, will stay in place for 20 or 30 years. A different approach to distribution and annotation thus seems necessary.</quotation><pages>5</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title>All of this activity will create new digital ...</title><comment/><quotation>All of this activity will create new digital objects that ideally I should be able to make available to other readers interested in the text. But since I do my work as part of my job as researcher, I cannot simply give up ownership of these additions, but need to be able to tag them with my name, and I need to be able to control how these objects are used. This will also serve as an indicator of their trustworthiness (or lack thereof), based on my reputation among the groups of users of these texts. Use of the DVCS as indicated above does exactly support this kind of publication model. </quotation><pages>11</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title>A user never "owns" the publication in the ...</title><comment/><quotation>A user never "owns" the publication in the same way a book (or even a CD-ROM) can be owned. This means not only no marginal notes, but also the risk that access to the site might become impossible due to an interruption on the network, discontinuation of the service, or some other failure. </quotation><pages>3</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title>While they might not have the same bells ...</title><comment/><quotation>While they might not have the same bells and whistles that users have become accustomed to in modern web-based publications, they will require much less maintenance and </quotation><pages>11</pages></tss:note>

If a book is used in such a way for an extended period of time, such marks will form a record of previous readings and interactions with the book. </quotation><pages>4</pages></tss:note>
<tss:note><title>This will lead me to a proposal for ...</title><comment/><quotation>This will lead me to a proposal for implementing what I will call "active reading" in the digital medium, a proposal that includes both an architectural part and ideas for a concrete implementation. </quotation><pages>2</pages></tss:note>

Such systems are currently mainly used in software development, but other uses are already beginning 3  and will likely become more widespread.</quotation><pages>6</pages></tss:note>
