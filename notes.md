# Biographical notes

There are family relations between the Qāsimīs in the two journals

Jamāl al-Dīn al-Qāsimi (*al-Muqtabas*) and Muḥammad al-Qāsimī (al-Ḥallāq)

## Muqtabas

The four men out of the five, for which we can find biographical records, are in many aspects exemplary of the modernising late Ottoman Empire and the Middle East: Coming from a plurality of religious and social backgrounds---Greek Orthodox, Catholic and Sunnī Muslim, priest and leading Salafi thinker of the second generation, part-time officials, of simple means and members of the old elites---they belonged to the same generation (born between the mid-1860s and mid-1870s){-- and worked as journalists, teachers, and occasionally politicians. All of them--}, were highly mobile and well-travelled and had good command of local as well as foreign languages{>> to the extent that some of them published translations<<}.

Those four out of the five men for which we can retrieve matching records from VIAF, belonged to the same generation (born between the mid-1860s and mid-1870s) and were prolific authors (judged by the numbers of published works in VIAF). However, by the latter metric, many other authors were just as, if not more, important: Shakīb Arslān (rank: 12), Amīn Rīḥānī (30), Muḥibb al-Dīn al-Khaṭīb (20), Aḥmad Taymūr (6), Aḥmad Zakkī (6), Aḥmad Shawqī (52).

A further look at the four biographies reveals a telling plurality of social and religious backgrounds:

### Maʿrūf al-Ruṣāfī (1875--1945)

Arabist, journalist, politician. Born in Baghdad, dropped out of the military *rüşdiye* school and continued his studies with Maḥmūd Shukrī al-Alūsī. Worked as a teacher in Baghdad before he moved to Istanbul after the Young Turk Revolution, where he worked as Arabic teacher at the "Royal College" and at the newspaper *Sabīl al-Rashad*---a move that is well reflected in *al-Muqtabas*. He was elected MP for al-Muthanna (Iraq) in 1912 and 1914. After WWI he became member of the Arab Scientific Academy, established by Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī in Damascus.

            - but articles in the Beiruti press suggest 1910 as the correct publication date.
- to do: check if the qaṣīdas printed in magazines were taken from the *Dīwān*
    + some of them can be found in the Hindawi edition of the *Dīwān* but were they part of the original majmūʿ

### ʿĪsā Iskandar al-Maʿlūf (1869--)

Born in the village of Kafr ʿAqqāb in Mt. Lebnon.  Educated across Lebanon and in the Greek Orthodox school in Damascus. Co-editor of the periodicals *Lubnān*, *al-ʿAṣr al-Jadīd* and *al-Nuʿma*. In 1911 he established the journal *al-Āthār* (published only 5 volumes){>> in Zaḥle<<}. Collector of books and manuscripts: AUB holds some 500 manuscripts from his private collection.
After WWI he became member of the Arab Scientific Academy, established by Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī in Damascus.

### Sātisnā (1866--1947)

Carmelite priest and Arabic linguist. His father was from Mt. Lebanon and moved to Baghdad, where he married. Buṭrus studied at religious schools, moved to Beirut in 1886 to study at the Jesuit college and continued his studies in Liege (Belgium) and Montpellier (France). Remained in France at least until the mid-1890s, where he was ordained a priest, before he returned to Baghdad. Prolific writer and contributor to periodicals under various pen names. He published his own philological journal, *Lughat al-ʿArab*, from 1911 onwards.

### Yūsuf Jirjis Zakham (1880--?)

Yūsuf Jirjis Zakham signed a number of articles in *al-Muqtabas* and other publications. He also provided a number of locations in Nebraska as places of writing. It is difficult to establish the anglicised version of his name, but there are numerous members of the Zakem family in Nebraska in the early 20th century. **Joseph George** can be assumed as his forenames.

He was born between 1880-01-07 (1920 census), 1880-04-20 (1910) and 1881-01-06 (1920 census)

### Jamāl al-Dīn al-Qāsimī (1866--1914)

Damascene notable and Sunni scholar. Travelled to Egypt in 1312 aH. Opened a school in Damascus that was shut down by the Vali in 1313 aH. Taught in his family home. Prolific contributor to newspapers and journals. 72 book manuscripts

## Ḥaqāʾiq

The picture is different for *al-Ḥaqāʾiq*, which was repeatedly in conflict with *al-Muqtabas* over the latter's supposed moral laxity. Its most prolific contributors were Damascene Sunni religious scholars from notable families, many of whom were at least one generation older than its opponents, e.g. Ibrāhīm Mardam Bek, Muḥammad ʿĀrif al-Munīr al-Ḥusaynī (b.1847/48), Mukhtār al-Muʾayyad (b.1822) and Muḥammad al-Qāsimī (b.1843), whose son Jamāl al-Dīn al-Qāsimī published in *al-Muqtabas*. Against this backdrop the initially surprising finding of practically no overlap between the two networks of authors published in journals from the same city, becomes less so (Fig. 5).

Ibrāhīm Mardam Bek, Muḥammad Farīd Wajdī (1875--1954), Muḥammad ʿĀrif al-Munīr al-Ḥusaynī (1847--), ʿAbd al-Rahmān al-Qaṣṣār (1863--1931), Muḥammad al-Qāsimī (al-Ḥallāq, 1843--1900), Ṣāliḥ al-Sharīf (1869--1920), Mukhtār al-Muʾayyad (1822--1921)

### Muḥammad Farīd Wajdī (1875--1954) (Ziriklī 6:329)

Born in Alexandria, moved to Damietta and Suez, died in Cairo. Published the journal *al-Ḥayyāt* in Suez. Wrote at least some of his books in French. Moved to Cairo, where he published the daily newspaper *al-Dustur* for some period before he established the weekly *al-Wajdiyāt*. Became one of the editors of *al-Azhar*

### Muḥammad ʿĀrif al-Munīr al-Ḥusaynī (1848--1923)

Damascene Shafīʿī jurisprudent. Born and died in Damascus.

### ʿAbd al-Rahmān al-Qaṣṣār (1863--1931)

Born and died in Damascus.

### Muḥammad al-Qāsimī al-Ḥallāq (1843--1900)
