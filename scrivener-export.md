## Abstract ##

The essay explores *digital history* for the systematic study of the periodical press in the late Ottoman Eastern Mediterranean (1906--18) as discursive field. It evaluates the methodological and practical challenges of *digital history* as rooted in socio-technical infrastructures of the Global North for the study of the Global South. It does so through a case study of four Arabic journals from Baghdad, Beirut, Cairo, and Damascus. After outlining the need for and challenges of corpus building efforts, this digital corpus of a total of c. 2,65 million words is explored through (social) network analysis and stylometric authorship attribution.

# Introduction #

This essay discusses the challenges and promises of *digital history*---broadly understood as historiography aided by computational approaches to research questions and based on {==digitised==}{>>Better "digital"?<<} sources[^fn1]---for the study of historical societies of the Global South. I do so through the {--ideosphere --}{++intellectual history++} of the late Ottoman Eastern {==Mediterranean==}{>>One could reference [@Scheffler+2003] on the mental maps of Southwest Asia<<}. The latter is a lose moniker for the predominantly Arabic speaking provinces of the Ottoman Empire along the eastern shore of the Mediterranean between the mountains of Anatolia in the north, Mesopotamia in the east, the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula in the south, and the Libyan desert in the west, between the mid-nineteenth century and the collapse of Ottoman rule during {--the end of--} World War I. {--encompassing the modern countries (or parts thereof) of Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, Jordan, Egypt, Sudan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Yemen. The period is delineated by the advent of the press (c.1860) and the collapse of Ottoman rule with the end of WW I (1918). --}I explore this topic through the history of the region's {--predominantly--} Arabic periodical {==press==}{>>add footnote to illustrate this claim? I originally thought I could just point to Project Jarāʾid but we only recorded Arabic and bi-lingual papers.<<} and by applying the spatial metaphor of an *ideosphere* as a reference to the realm of human ideas in its entirety, only some of which become manifest and thus traceable in concrete intellectual production. With *ideosphere*, I argue that one has to transcend individual periodicals and engage in the systematic study of the periodical press as a discursive field and at scale in order to better understand both the intellectual history of the Eastern Mediterranean at a crucial historical juncture and periodical production itself. It is important to note that most of the challenges of *digital history* discussed here are in no way limited to the specific case study. Instead, I present particularly pronounced variations of a theme that will ring true for all historians at a moment when the question whether something is digital or not has become increasingly meaningless and when the computational has become hegemonic as everything has already always been mediated through technology.[^fn2]

Early Arabic periodicals{-- from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries--}, such as <persName>Butrus al-Bustānī</persName>'s *al-Jinān* (Beirut, 1876--86), <persName>Yaʿqūb Ṣarrūf</persName>, <persName>Fāris Nimr</persName>, and <persName>Shāhīn Makāriyūs</persName>'s *al-Muqtaṭaf* (Beirut and Cairo, 1876--1952), <persName>Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī</persName>'s *al-Muqtabas* (Cairo and Damascus, 1906--18/19) or <persName>Rashīd Riḍā</persName>'s *al-Manār* (Cairo, 1898--1941) are at the core of formative discourses that still reverberate through the Arabic-speaking Middle East: the Arabic (cultural) renaissance (*nahḍa*), Arab nationalism, and Islamic reform movements{-- (ṣalafiyya--}{>> GuG: Since salafiyya nowadays is a very vaguely connoted concept (to the point of being meaningless) and the early reform movement of Abduh is already quite different from Rida, I'd suggest to perhaps also use a plural here?

The periodical press of the late Ottoman Eastern Mediterranean has received scholarly attention since the early twentieth century.[^fn3] Yet, core questions concerning the intellectual history of the periodical press and the social history of periodical production are still unanswered. Arabic approaches to the periodical press have been, for a long time, both encyclopaedic and anecdotal as well as biased by an almost exclusive focus on Cairo and Beirut. Many of these works were compiled by authors who themselves were journalist and adhere to a specific political view of Arab nationalism and demonize the Ottoman Empire, particularly during the reign of Sultan <persName>ʿAbdülḥamīd II</persName> (1876--1909).[^fn4] Non-Arabic scholarship adopted similar geographic and political biases and commonly perceives of periodicals as a *source* for intellectual, social and political history but only rarely as a *subject* in its own right. There is the noteworthy exception of Ami Ayalon's extensive writings on the press in the Arab Middle East,[^fn5] but comprehensive, synthesising approaches are severely limited by the almost complete absence of systematic studies on {==individual periodicals==}{>>GuG: 
1. Florian Zemmin on al Manar? The work of Dyala Hamzah ? 
2. Stefan Conermann in Bonn hatte auch mal (2014)  ein größeres DH Projekt zu arabischen, osmanischen und persischen Zeitschriften, ist daraus eigentlich etwas geworden?

Till:
re 1: I added a comment on Zemmin in the text. Zemmin's work is more concerned with conceptual history or the history of ideas and particularly the concept of "modernity". While his book/thesis contextualises *al-Manār* on some twenty pages it does not pretend to be a comprehensive study of this journal.
re 1: Both Zemmin and Hamzah focus on particular aspects and the content of articles published al-Manar and not the periodical itself, its history of publication, its modes of production, its distribution to readers etc. Their interest lies in topics far beyond the individual periodical. As such, I would group them under scholarship that perceives periodicals as a source. 
re 2: I was part of the initial conference but I am not aware of an actual project in Bonn. Translatio seems to be an umbrella for repeated, small-scale scanning efforts<<}.[^cf1]{>>Add comment on [@Dierauff+2018][@Beška+2017]<<} Even scholarly approaches to the press as a *source* remain largely anecdotal with a focus on opinion pieces and editorials in a small sample of canonical journals from Beirut and Cairo. The main reasons are scale and scattered collections, which, however, remain {--completely--}{>>{--largely--}<<}{-- --}unacknowledged.
Consider two recent examples: While {==Zemmin==}{>>Should I add Zemmin's second claim?<<} acknowledges that <persName>Rafīq al-ʿAẓm</persName> published in *al-Hilāl*, *al-Muqtaṭaf*, *al-Ahrām*, and *al-Muqattam*, he does not comment on his selection of four articles {--by al-ʿAẓm--} from *al-Manār*,[^fn6] which is most likely due to the latter's availability in digital form.[^fn7] Zemmin also claims that al-ʿAẓm was "a core contributor to al-Manar" without elaborating the criteria for his evaluation.[^fn8] Similarly, Zachs claims to illustrate a "debate" by picking two articles---one from 1886 and published in Cairo, the other from 1894 and published in Beirut---without commenting on this choice and its implications.[^fn9] What is needed, therefore, are transparency about methods and the actual sources at hand as well as empirically grounded approaches.

In consequence, we still {==need to answer the question==}{>>alternative: cannot answer the following question empiricaly/ we have no reliable empiricial answer to the question<<} of what are the core nodes (authors, periodicals, other texts) in the ideosphere of the late Ottoman Eastern Mediterranean and how did these networks develop over time?

It presents a first foray into computational approaches to these questions by adopting methods broadly summarised as *distant reading*, namely social network analysis and stylometry for authorship attribution. {--Computational methods depend on digital corpora. --}I start by confronting hyperbolic promises of mass digitisation and computational methods {--for the exploration of digitised cultural heritage--} as a hegemonic episteme rooted in late twentieth-century, english-speaking{--, neoliberal--} capitalism from the margins---That is, the study of a historical multilingual society whose material heritage has been looted, destroyed and neglected; A society, whose written textual heritage resists digitisation efforts by being dependent on non-Latin scripts, which cannot reliably be extracted from facsimiles due to the limitations of available OCR technologies{-- and, for instance, non-Gregorian calendars--}; A society, whose contemporary heirs between Mosul, Basra, Aleppo, Homs, the two Tripolis, Maʿān, Gaza, and Khartoum cannot draw on the vast resources in wealth and socio-technical infrastructures of the Global North (or Gulf countries).

I, therefore, introduce my own corpus-building project ["Open Arabic Periodical Editions" (OpenArabicPE)](https://openarabicpe.github.io/) as a framework to address the outlined challenges to mass digitisation of Arabic periodicals by combining transcriptions of a small number of early twentieth-century journals from {==shadow==}{>>GuG: was heisst dies?

Consequently, any corpus built {==with these affordances==}{>>better wording<<} and the dependence on the work of anonymous others will not be systematically tailored to our research questions. But it is currently the only corpus of Arabic periodicals that can be subjected to computational analysis.

# The promised land of digitised Arabic periodicals #

The better known and at the time widely popular Arabic journals of the late Ottoman Empire{-----unlike their smaller rivals and more ephemeral newspaper copies-----}{++ ++}do not face the ultimate danger of their last copy being destroyed in the current onslaught from iconoclasts, institutional neglect, and wars raging through Syria, Libya, Yemen, and Iraq. Yet, copies are scattered across libraries and private collections worldwide. Many collections remain unknown to scholarly communities. If catalogues exist, they are not necessarily available online and union catalogues have fallen out of fashion.[^fn12] 

An example shall illustrate this point{-- ([@fig:holdings-muqtabas])--}{>> I removed the map.<<}. A {==search in WorldCat==}{>>GuG: Problem, dass WorldCat im Prinzip nur für Europa und Nordamerika wirklich zuverlässige Angaben macht?

Till: this paragraph is not concerned with (neo)colonial issues but with collections being scattered. WorldCat and ArUC are means to demonstrate this issue. The previous paragraph outlines absence and inaccessibility of finding aids for Middle Eastern holding institutions.<<} for the nine volumes of *al-Muqtabas* returns six different bibliographic entries, the first of which has 13 variants (called "editions" by WorldCat), pointing to 34 libraries. If one follows each entry to the holding library's catalogue, one will find that the large majority of collections is incomplete and that collections commonly combine original volumes, reprints, microfilms, microfiches and even photo {==copies==}{>>comment on the geographic distribution of collections: the map below shows a surprising distribution of copies, which could either be due to Worldcat's bias towards western collections or a reflection of actual holdings. But even for regions with good coverage, such as central Europe, we can attest that interested readers would need to travel or depend on interlibrary loans to excess every issue of al-Muqtabas.<<}. This makes it almost impossible to trace discourses across journals and with the demolition and closure of libraries in the Middle East, copies are increasingly accessible to the affluent Western researcher only.[^fn13]

The first question we encounter in our attempt to {==track the network of authors and texts==}{>>GuG: Dies ist nun eine recht spezifische Fragestellung. Wenn das Ihr Hauptinteresse ist, wäre es gut, es in der Einleitung auch so zu formulieren (und vielleicht einzubetten in die Diskussion anderer digitaler Projekte zur Netzwerk Analyse, wie der Republic of Letters.
Till: Ich glaube das ist durch die neugefasste Einleitung geschehen<<} is to which extent can we submit *digitised* periodicals to computational analysis, or rather, what is the meaning of *digitised* and *access*? The answer is{--, of course,--} very different from periodical corpora in Western languages{--. It is sobering and will put off but the most enthusiastic readers--}: from large corporate and institution-backed platforms[^fn14] to shadow libraries[^fn15] *digitised* in the context of Arabic and Ottoman periodicals commonly means {--nothing more than--} the provision of digital facsimiles---and, sometimes, even "fakesimiles": a digital text rendered with a layout meant to emulate the material artefact and served as an image file. While scanning and hosting millions of pages is a laudable endeavour, digital facsimiles provide access only to human readers and solely enable close-reading approaches similar to how we encounter the original artefact or microfilm copies. [^cf2]

Optical character recognition (OCR), the technology to convert an image into machine-readable text, has come a long way and even hand-written text recognition (HTR) is fairly successful at least for Latin script.[^fn16] Automatic recognition of Arabic script, however, is severely lagging behind for a variety of reasons beyond the scope of this essay.[^fn17] Despite promising developments with the application of machine-learning technologies to pattern recognition,[^fn18] automatic conversion of images of early Arabic periodicals is hampered by three factors: first, all OCR technologies depend on training sets of "gold standard" transcriptions as ground truth; second, low-quality fonts, inks, and paper employed at the turn of the twentieth century will inevitably result in poor print quality and reduce the reliability of automatic transcription through variance; and third, text recognition depends on layout recognition and multi-column texts with various intersections of boilerplate, ads, etc. pose serious {==challenges==}{>>GuG: AND there are a number of quite uncoordinated approaches in Russia and various places in the West (and probably the Arab world, too)
Till: this is so true!<<}. 
Consequently these texts can currently only be reliably digitised by human transcription.[^cf3] Funds for transcribing the tens to hundreds of thousands of pages of an average mundane periodical are simply not available, despite of their cultural significance and unlike {--for --}{++what is being done with++} valuable manuscripts and high-brow literature.

Some platforms either ignore the problem, actively pretend it doesn't exist, or claim to have solved it and therefore foreground search functions. Reasons range from Arabic being a marginal language in their corpus to the need to return a profit on investment through selling extremely expensive subscriptions to institutions. The advertised search functions are severely limited and often deceptive. 
[Hathitrust](http://catalog.hathitrust.org/), a Google-powered conglomerate of mostly American universities, is obviously dysfunctional for Arabic text if one has a look at the text layer.
The commercial ["Early Arabic Printed Books" (EAPB) project](https://www.gale.com/intl/primary-sources/early-arabic-printed-books-from-the-british-library) was developed by Cengage Gale in collaboration with the British Library and makes repeated claims of employing "[n]ewly-developed optical character recognition software (OCR) for early Arabic printed script".[^fn19] But since they share neither text layers nor error rates or software, their claims cannot be verified.  
[East View's](https://www.eastview.com/) digital Arabic periodical collections (some free to use, some subscription-based) cover the middle ground. While they rely on extremely messy OCR data, which they invite their users/customers to manually improve, the interface focuses on the search box. As long as platforms show search results as highlights superimposed upon the facsimile, one can catch (the many) false positives. We will, however, never know the extent of false negatives{-- (one can manually check for false positives by going through the search results)--}.

The digital text of a periodical is necessary but not sufficient for many analytical queries and distant reading and it is certainly insufficient for close reading.[^fn20] The full text of a periodical would be nothing but a string of words. But periodicals unite different texts of various genres from multiple authors. These texts are commonly grouped into issues and volumes. Longer ones are frequently serialised and scattered across issues. Some of these texts are reprints from other periodicals or first printed editions of much older manuscripts. {--Some of the texts are responses, etc.--} Therefore the full text has to be *modelled* in order to make sense of {--the full text of a--} periodical for both humans and machines.[^cf4] Will Hanley's effort of modelling the OCR'ed issues of the newspaper *[Egyptian Gazette](https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/)* (Alexandria, 1905--08) with the help of his students as part of a digital micro-history course since 2016 demonstrates how tedious this work is even with an English baseline.[^fn21]


Even the provision of *digitised facsimiles* and *raw OCR output* does not mean *access* for all and to everything. Digital infrastructures, despite all promises towards the opposite, are rooted in the {--epistemic--} hegemony of late twentieth-century{--, neoliberal--} capitalism and the Global North. Most digitised periodicals are kept in opaque data silos. In the absence of provisions for interchange or interoperability in the form of application programming interfaces ({==APIs==}{>>Explain!<<}) or the option to bulk download data in standardised, open file formats, *access* to these silos is restricted to human readers and provided through proprietary web-interfaces that are commonly neither tailored to the display of Arabic material nor themselves available in Arabic [C.f. @Mansour+2020; @Wrisley+2019; @Wrisley+2016]. Such (close) reading *access* {--to these silos--} is further restricted by paywalls, licenses, and geo-fencing.[^fn22] Downloading content in order to circumvent {>>geo-fencing and<<} ill-suited interfaces is limited to individually identifiable users. Bulk download frequently violates terms of use and most vendors try to prevent this on the technical level.

To computationally answer the above questions, however, one would need unrestricted access to truly *digital* editions---that is, machine-readable editions of the full text with embedded structural and semantic information and in a standardised {==exchange==}{>>GuG: Grundsätzliches Problem: wie schnell veraltet Literatur, wie die von Ihnen in der Fn genannte?

Till: Digital scholarly editing is probably the oldest strand of what since has become known as digital humanities. As such, introductions and textbooks from the mid-2010s can hardly be considered outdated. I would generally argue that the shelf-life of theoretical and methodological texts is much longer than of those presenting workflows (i.e. the concrete implementation with tools and formats of a method, which, in turn, is based on/derived from theoretical considerations).<<} format.[^fn23]

In the absence of *digital* editions, any meaningful computational analysis of the connections between authors, texts, and periodicals as a venue for publication and review requires access to reliable standardised bibliographic metadata as a bare minimum. Unfortunately, even this data is practically non-existent. This is due {++to a combination of factors: 1)++} ambiguity and incorrect data found in the original artefact; {--to --}2){-- --}lacking familiarity with the particularities of these artefacts among cataloguers, librarians and scholars; and {--to --}3) a software stack ill-suited for anything but Western concepts of dates and names and Western {==scripts==}{>>Till: emphasis that digitisation emphasises pre-existing problems<<}.

{==Periodicals seem to provi==}{>>GuG: Um der Effektivität des Arguments willen, könnte man darüber nachdenken, diese Fragen zu trennen von dem Angriff auf neokoloniale Strukturen in der Wissenschaft – es sind zwei Sets von Problemen, die nur bedingt miteinander in Verbindung stehen (oder Sie müssten die Verbindung wirklich stark machen – das Problem der Datierung und der Namen ist eines, was zunächst einmal nichts mit akademischen Strukturen zu tun hat, und mit dem sich Wissenschaftler schon lange vor dem Computerzeitalter herumgeschlagen haben. Es ließe sich (vielleicht!) zum Teil mit mehr Geld lösen, aber doch auch nur zum Teil. Ein Digitalisierungsprojekt, das händisch alle Daten und Namen überprüft, um Verwechslungen auszuschließen, scheint kaum machbar.

Till: 
Ich versuche in diesem Abschnitt drei Probleme aufzuzeigen, die zu einer zunehmden Degradierung der Datenqualität führen je weiter man sich vom materiellen Artefakt entfernt:
1. Die auf dem zu digitalisierenden Artefakt angegebenen Metadaten sind teilweise uneindeutig und falsch.
2. Die Personen, die diese Daten erfassen sollen haben mangelnde Kenntnisse (kennen sich z.B. nicht mit den relevanten Kalendern aus). Hier kommen zum ersten Mal kapitalistische Strukturen zum Tragen, da viele Schritte der Digitalisierung an Ketten von Subunternehmen ausgelagert werden.
3. Die technische Infrastruktur mit der diese Daten erfasst werden sollen/müssen basiert auf der epistemologischen Hegemonie des Globalen Nordens und erlaubt keine Erfassung nicht-gregorianischer Daten.<<}de no dating challenges as publication dates were conveniently recorded in a masthead. However, periodicals across the Arabic speaking late Ottoman Eastern Mediterranean made use of at least four calendars. Newspapers and journals provided dates in any combination of the Ottoman fiscal, or *mālī* calendar and the reformed Julian calendar as well as the better known Islamic *hijri* and Gregorian calendars. In addition to at least three different year counts, these calendars and their users also differed in their conception of the calendric day. Most retained the old notion of a day commencing at sundown, while others adopted *alla franca* time with 24 equinoctial hours and a date change at midnight.[^cf5] Unfortunately supplied dates from mastheads frequently neither matched each other nor the day of the week the paper was supposedly printed on.[^cf6]{-- A particularly illuminating example in our corpus can be found in the masthead to issue 6 of the Damascene journal al-Ḥaqāʾiq that read "First of the holy month of Muḥarram 1229 [hijrī], 3 Kānūn Awwal 1327 [mālī], and 20 December (Kānūn Awwal) of the year 1911 [Gregorian]". This line contains at least four errors: First the hijrī date is set in the wrong century and should read 1329. Second, the days of the mālī and Gregorian dates got mixed up. The Gregorian calendar was thirteen days ahead of Julian calendars since the year 1900. The corrected mālī date should read 20 Kānūn Awwal instead of the third, but because the mālī years began in spring with the month of mārt (March), the year count should not have been incremented to 1327 with the beginning of the new hijrī year. Therefore the correct mālī date would have been "20 Kānūn Awwal 1326". The Gregorian date, finally, is even wrong after fixing the mix-up of days with the mālī date. Instead of Kānūn Awwal (December) it should be Kānūn Thānī (January) and since December has 31 days, the correct Gregorian date should ultimately read "2 (instead of the substituted 3 from the original, faulty, mālī date) January 1911".--} How should one record this bibliographic nightmare? And which date-calendar combination should be considered the authoritative one? What if recorded publication dates were fictional to simulate a regular publication cycle and should therefore be conceived of as issue numbers that have only limited relation to an actual date?[^cf7]{>>al-Ḥaqāʾiq 1(6) referenced an article in al-Muqtabas 1 December 1910 (#539)<<}

Any attempt to answer these questions relies on the affordances of available information systems, that is people and their skills, abstract concepts, and actual tools to record and retrieve these data points. But cataloguers, librarians and even specialists of the late Ottoman Eastern Mediterranean are frequently unfamiliar with calendric systems beyond the solar Gregorian and the lunar Islamic *hijrī* calendars. *Mālī* years are frequently misread as *hijrī* years, which introduces a margin of error of up to two years for the last decades before World War I.[^cf8] Second, most software is unable to work with anything but Gregorian dates out of the box. Even if cataloguers were able to correctly establish the calendar used in a periodical's masthead, the computing infrastructure would not allow them to enter this date into the digital record.[^cf9] Finally, bibliographic data is not commonly shared in a standard-compliant and machine-actionable format{--, such as MARC or MODS--} even when it is internally kept in structured form.[^fn24] 

A good example for this state of affairs is the British Library's otherwise excellent Endangered Archives Programme (EAP), which digitised periodical holdings of the al-Aqsa Mosque's library in Jerusalem (EAP119).[^cf10] {>>they claim to have scanned images in 2007 according 2009 guidelines <<}If we look at the [fourth volume](https://eap.bl.uk/archive-file/EAP119-1-4-3) of the journal *al-Muqtabas* available through EAP, we find that bibliographic information is solely provided in unstructured plain text{-- either through the web interface or the IIIF API--}.[^cf11] Publication dates are provided as Gregorian months even though the cover clearly states that *al-Muqtabas* follows the "Arabic", i.e. Islamic *hijrī*, calendar and despite each issue reporting the publication date as *hijrī* month. Consequently, there is a dissonance between the facsimile and the bibliographic information. *al-Muqtabas* 4(1) recorded the month of Muḥarram 1327 aH in its masthead. Depending on the local observation of the moon in Damascus, the journal's place of publication, this month began around 27 January 1909. Should *al-Muqtabas* 4(1) therefore be considered the January or the February issue? The cataloguers at EAP clearly thought the latter or their cataloguing software did not allow for date ranges.

Even if we had perfectly reliable digital re-mediations of the bibliographic information found in the periodical issues themselves, the vast majority of articles would remain outside our analytical scopes because publishers did not provide (meaningful) bylines---most articles in journals and newspapers from Baghdad, Beirut, Cairo or Damascus did not credit their authors. One approach is to subject all articles to stylometric analysis for authorship attribution (more on this below) but this again presupposes truly *digital* editions.

# Building a corpus of digital Arabic periodicals #

This state of *digitised* Arabic periodicals puts the onus of building a digital corpus on us---scholars of the late Ottoman ideosphere interested in leveraging computational approaches to answer pressing questions of the field. Like many others I, turned to the shadow libraries of Arabic literature, such as *[al-Maktaba al-Shāmila](http://www.shamela.ws/)*, *[Mishkāt](http://almeshkat.net/)*, *[Ṣayyid al-Fawāʾid](http://saaid.net/)* or *[al-Waraq](http://www.alwaraq.net/)*. They provide access to {--a vast body of--} (mostly classical) Arabic texts including transcriptions of unknown provenance, editorial principles, and quality for a small number of periodicals. These informal "editions" lack information linking the digital representation to the original artefact, namely bibliographic metadata and page breaks, which makes them almost impossible to validate and therefore employ for scholarly research.

Since we do not have the resources to proof and correct these texts, I conceived of ["Open Arabic Periodical Editions" (OpenArabicPE, 2015--)](https://openarabicpe.github.io/) as a framework for open, collaborative, and fully-referencable scholarly digital editions of early Arabic periodicals.[^fn25] OpenArabicPE addresses the above-mentioned issues of existing collections of *digitised* Arabic periodicals with an emphasis on *accessibility*, *sustainability*, and *credibility*. It builds on the simple idea of combining the virtues of immensely popular, but non-academic {--(and, at least under US copyright laws, occasionally illegal)--} shadow libraries{-- of volunteers--} {--on the one hand--} with academic and commercial scanning efforts as well as editorial expertise{-- on the other--}.

Starting with the mostly Damascene periodicals *al-Muqtabas* and *al-Ḥaqāʾiq*, we devised workflows and tools to transform digital texts (badly formatted HTML) from *[al-Maktaba al-Shāmila](http://www.shamela.ws/)* into an open, standardised file format (XML) based on the [Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)](https://www.tei-c.org/)'s guidelines,[^fn26] to generate bibliographic metadata, and to render a parallel display of text and facsimile in a web browser. We model the periodicals through adding structural mark-up for articles, sections, authors, and bibliographic metadata. Our {==schema==}{>>Comment on our schema for solving the above mentioned issues of dating and entity names<<} to do so also addresses the problems outlined above and divised ways how to encode and---as far as possible---computationally normalise non-Gregorian dates and Arabic-Ottoman entity names. Finally, we link each page to facsimiles from various sources, namely [EAP](http://eap.bl.uk/), [HathiTrust](http://catalog.hathitrust.org/), and *[Arshīf al-majallāt al-adabiyya wa-l-thaqāfiyya al-](http://archive.alsharekh.org/)ʿarabiyya*.[^fn27] The latter step, in the process of which we also make first corrections to the transcription, although trivial, is the most labour-intensive because page breaks were commonly ignored by *al-Maktaba al-Shāmila*'s anonymous transcribers. {--This point needs to be emphasised: e--}{++E++}ach of the c.8500 pages breaks in *al-Muqtabas* and *al-Ḥaqāʾiq* needed to be manually marked by volunteers in order to link facsimiles to the digital text and thus make the text verifiable for human readers.[^cf12] So far Dimitar Dragnev, Talha Güzel, Dilan Hatun, Hans Magne Jaatun, Xaver Kretzschmar, Daniel Lloyd, Klara Mayer, Tobias Sick, Manzi Tanna-Händel and Layla Youssef have contributed their time to this task.

All tools and the editions are hosted on the code-sharing platform [GitHub](https://www.github.com/) under the most permissive licenses {--MIT and Creative Commons [CC BY-SA 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) licenses--} for reading, contribution, and re-use. Retaining copyright of our own editorial contributions in the form of [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International](<http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/>) is a reminder that the enourmous amount of, often contingent, labour embodied in digital resources need to be transparently credited. We also provide structured bibliographic metadata for every article in machine-readable formats that can easily be integrated into larger bibliographic information systems. This bibliographic data is also accessible through a constantly updated public [Zotero group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/OpenArabicPE), which can serve as a port of entry to the editions.

{==With OpenArabicPE, I argue that by linking facsimiles to the digital text, every reader can validate the quality of the transcription against the original.==}{>>GuG: 
- Inwiefern löst dies die oben genannten Probleme mit Datierungen und Namen? 
- Jeder Wissenschaftler kann sie selber überprüfen, wenn sie will, aber bevor dies nicht getan ist, nützt die Quelle als Korpus für weitergehende Volltextanalysen doch noch immer nicht mehr, oder? Das gleiche gilt für Transkriptionsfehler – sie werden korrigierbar, das ist schon ein gewaltiger Fortschritt, aber heißt dies, dass die transkribierten Texte jetzt vertrauenswürdige Grundlage für die Analysen geworden sind? Oder ist dies eine Hoffnung für die Zukunft, dass Crowd sourcing irgendwann genügend „perfekte" Texte produziert, dass man sie verwenden kann?

Till:
- Es sind entscheidende Schritte gemacht:
	1. Alles, sowohl die digitalisierten Originale, als auch sämtliche Teile der digitalen Edition, ist transparent zitierbar.
	2. Die Zeitschriften sind modelliert und damit auf der Artikelebene und seitengenau bibliographisch erschlossen.
	3. Die bibliographischen Metadaten der einzelnen Ausgaben sind validiert.
	4. Signifikante Lücken in der Transkription sind markiert worden.
- Damit lassen sich die Editionen nutzen für 
	1. gezieltes close reading; 
	2. computer-basierte Analyse (distant reading) der bibliographischen Metadaten und Volltexten auf der Artikelebene

- Dem Kommentar der Gutachter_in liegt eine irrtürmliche Annahme zugrunde, nämlich, dass Volltextanalysen nur mit einer perfekten Transkription gemacht werden könnten. Dies ist, je nach Fragestellung nicht der Fall. In einer Fußnote im Abschnitt zu OCR erläutere ich das wie folgt: "If one was, for instance, interested in distant reading approaches to large corpora, such as the temporal distribution of certain keywords during a long print run, this would allow not just for aggregation on the issue level but probably even periods of full months and more. In consequence, error margins of almost one fourth in both Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER) become seemingly acceptable; e.g. [@Cristianini+2018, 144]." <<} We thus remove the greatest limitation of crowd-sourced or informal transcriptions and the main source of disciplinary contempt among historians and scholars of the Middle East. Anyone can improve the transcription as well as our modelling of a journal's content with clear attribution of authorship and version control using .git and GitHub's core functionality.[^fn28]

## OpenArabicPE's corpus ##

{==The resulting corpus==}{>>GuG: Vielleicht noch ein paar Sätze zu den Selektionskriterien? Warum gerade diese Zeitschriften? Hätte es Alternativen gegeben, und warum haben Sie gerade diese Entscheidung getroffen?

Till:
I did explain the state of digital copora in my field above and concluded that one has to engage in corpus building. I also explained that, inter alia, due to the abysmal state of Arabic OCR, I had to build on what is there. The current paragraph even mentions that this is the only available periodical corpus. Finally, the following section focusses on the necessary evaluation of the corpus.<<} {--employed for the present paper--} comprises the full text of each issue of *Lughat al-ʿArab*, *al-Muqtabas* and *al-Ḥaqāʾiq* until the end of World War I and a transcription of article titles and bylines for one volume of *al-Ḥasnāʾ*, totalling 165 full-text journal issues with some 2,65 million words ([@tbl:corpus]).[^fn29] Titles were selected based on the state of the digital editions and for their geographic ditribution. This corpus is small if compared to the vast data sets available for the Global North through [Chronicling America](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/), [Trove](https://trove.nla.gov.au/) Australia, the [British Newspaper Archive](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/) etc., which gave rise to numerous distant reading projects.[^fn30] However, it is the only corpus of this material. Taken with a grain of salt, a systematic analysis of this corpus helps us test common hypotheses, challenge established narratives about the Arabic periodical press and direct the focus of further scrutiny, as I will show in the following sections after briefly introducing the constituent periodicals.

Table: Summary of the periodical corpus. {#tbl:corpus}

<persName>Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī</persName> (1876--1953) established his journal *al-Muqtabas* (The Digest) in <placeName>Cairo</placeName> in 1906 and the first daily newspaper to be published in <placeName>Damascus</placeName> in 1908 (also confusingly called *al-Muqtabas*). He was the best known and, after the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, the most influential journalist and intellectual in <placeName>Damascus</placeName>. Before running his own periodicals, he had held minor government offices and worked at various public and private presses and periodicals in <placeName>Damascus</placeName> and <placeName>Cairo</placeName>. He was well-acquainted with leading figures of the Islamic reform movement in Egypt and Greater Syria. He was a member in <persName>Ṭāhir al-Jazāʾirī</persName>'s "senior circle" in the early 1890s in Damascus and later moved and worked in <persName>Rashīd Riḍā</persName>'s and <persName>Muḥammad ʿAbduh</persName>'s circles in Cairo. After the Young Turk Revolution, <persName>Kurd ʿAlī</persName> returned to his hometown and the publication of *al-Muqtabas* moved from Cairo to Damascus in the journal's third year. In Damascus, *al-Muqtabas* soon became "the boldest, most coherent, consistent and committed proponent of reform and modernity [...] prior to World War I".[^fn31] Due to conflicts with the authorities over the reprint of a poem, <persName>Kurd ʿAlī</persName> again fled Damascus for Cairo and Europe in 1912. Consequently, *al-Muqtabas* was published from Cairo for a couple of months before <persName>Kurd ʿAlī</persName> was allowed to return once again. During World War I and <persName>Cemal Pasha</persName>'s infamous term as commander-in-chief of the 4th Army and governor general of Syria, <persName>Kurd ʿAlī</persName> was able to win his support. He thus escaped the fate of <persName>Shukrī al-ʿAsalī</persName>, his co-editor at the newspaper *al-Muqtabas*, <persName>ʿAbd al-Ghanī al-ʿUraysī</persName> and other journalists from <placeName>Beirut</placeName> and <placeName>Damascus</placeName>, who were publicly executed on charges of treason. Like their editor, the journal and the newspaper *al-Muqtabas* survived and continued publication until the final days of the war---albeit in shorter and less frequent editions due to material shortages. After the end of the war and the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire, <persName>Kurd ʿAlī</persName> abandoned the monthly and left the editorship of the revived daily newspaper *al-Muqtabas* to his brother <persName>Aḥmad</persName>. He founded the Arab Scientific Academy whose president he became in 1919 and served twice as Minister of Education (1920--22, 1928--32) during the French Mandate over Syria.[^fn32]

Much less is known about the second Damascene journal in our corpus and the people behind it. *al-Ḥaqāʾiq* (The Facts) was a periodical of the conservative Muslim establishment, who called themselves *mutadayyinūn* (the very pious). A total of three volumes with 35 issues were published between 1910 and 1913 by the *ʿālim* (religious scholar) <persName>ʿAbd al-Qādir al-Iskandarānī</persName> (1875--1943). The journal had a strong focus on Islamic topics and published constant critiques of Salafism and "Westernised" journals, such as *al-Muqtabas*.[^fn33] Its page layout conveys an apparent lack of familiarity with the by then established conventions of Arabic journals, which {--further--} underlines its nature as an outlier in the ideosphere of Arabic periodicals. <persName>al-Iskandarānī</persName> came from the notable <persName>al-Kaylānī</persName> family, who were closely associated with the Qadriyya Sufi order. Unlike <persName>Kurd ʿAlī</persName>, he did not claim a single byline in "his" journal or any other periodical in our corpus. 
{==Pages contain==}{>>Cut?<<} much less text and issues are much shorter than those of  *al-Muqtabas*{-- with a total of 300186 words across 1436 pages (as some 17 pages are missing from the transcription, the word count is too low)--}.

The Carmelite Father <persName>Anastās Mārī al-Karmalī</persName> (born <persName>Buṭrus ʿAwwād</persName>, 1866--1947) from <placeName>Mt. Lebanon</placeName> established the monthly journal *Lughat al-ʿArab* (The Language of the Arabs) in <placeName>Baghdad</placeName> in 1911. The journal published 34 issues until its final number in June 1914. <persName>al-Karmalī</persName> was exiled to <placeName>Kayseri</placeName> in <placeName>Anatolia</placeName> upon the beginning of World War I and returned in summer 1916. *Lughat al-ʿArab* recommenced publication only in 1926.[^fn34] It is not clear to which extent al-Karmalī was involved as editor. Only a (small) handful of articles in *Lughat al-ʿArab* carried his byline. <persName>Kāẓim al-Dujaylī</persName> (1884--1970), a self-taught journalist and a poet and student of the Baghdadi Salafist <persName>Shukrī al-Alūsī</persName> and <persName>al-Karmalī</persName>, joined *Lughat al-ʿArab* as editor(-in-chief?) soon after. Issues were similar in length to *al-Ḥaqāʾiq*.

The monthly journal *al-Ḥasnāʾ* (The Fair Lady), published by <persName>Jirjī Niqūlā Bāz</persName> in <placeName>Beirut</placeName> between 1909 and 1911, was the first women's magazine in Greater Syria. Together with <persName>Marī ʿAjamī</persName>'s *al-ʿArūs* (The Bride, <placeName>Damascus</placeName> 1910--) and <persName>Salīma Abū Rashīd</persName>'s *Fatāt Lubān* (Girls of Lebanon, <placeName>Beirut</placeName> 1914--) and even though it was published by a man, *al-Ḥasnāʾ* was {--mostly a forum of--}{++part of a second wave of++} "politically engaged female writing".[^fn35]

# Network of authors and texts #

{--With major work on modelling on three journals from Baghdad, Cairo and Damascus---Lughat al-ʿArab, al-Muqtabas and al-Ḥaqāʾiq---done, we can now begin to submit this corpus to initial analyses of the social and geographic networks of authors and their texts as well as the network of periodicals referenced and cited in these three journals.--}

The quality and significance of the analysis of bibliographic data is directly dependent on the quality of the information provided by the periodicals themselves and of our mark-up in the digital editions. All relevant personal and place names in bylines and other source information must be marked up for retrieval. A core step is the necessary disambiguation of named entities through local and external authority files: "Anastās al-Karmalī", "Buṭrus ʿAwwad", "*Sātisnā*" and "The publisher of *Lughat al-ʿArab*", for example, refer to the same person, "*Ḥalab*" and "*al-Shahbāʾ*" both designated the city of <placeName>Aleppo</placeName>. By linking references to external authority files and the semantic web, we can harvest additional information on authors and locations, namely the geolocation for toponyms, transcriptions into Latin script necessary for working with most visualisation tools, and life dates for persons{-- in order to establish the age of authors upon publication--}{>> Comment on the issue of many visualisation tools, such as R and Gephi for macOS, not working with Arabic script<<}. It must be noted that, as in any other step along the process of this research project, scholars of non-Western societies are at a significant disadvantage. Automated named-entity recognition (NER) is well established for western languages but there are is currently no readily available software that supports Arabic.[^fn36] Openly available authority files, such as the [Virtual International Authority File (VIAF)](https://viaf.org/) that aggregates tens of national authority files, which, in turn, depend on expensive infrastructures, are subject to the same digital affordances alluded to above (English interface, names as combinations of fore- and surnames, Gregorian calendar). As a result, they are heavily biased towards the Global North.[^cf13]{>>Could be expanded<<}

## Evaluating the corpus: Network of referenced periodicals ##

Knowing that we work with a corpus whose composition is the result of external and unknown decisions by the contributors to *al-Maktaba al-Shāmila* as to which periodical to transcribe, we can evaluate the performance of this corpus in representing the larger ideosphere of the periodical press in the late Ottoman Eastern Mediterranean by looking at the network of referenced periodicals. Explicit references to periodicals indicated by "*jarīda* XYZ" or "*majalla* ABC" were automatically marked-up using XSLT and regular expressions and linked to local and external authority files for disambiguation and additional bibliographic information. I then counted the references to each mentioned periodical and plotted the result as a network graph. {==The plots feature the number of references by issue==}{>>Improve explanation<<} to account for the varying length of articles in each {==journal==}{>>sequencing into even-sized chunks might be a good idea for statistical validity<<}. Each node in the network plot ([@fig:network-periodicals]) signifies a periodical{-- (newspapers and journals are not distinguished at the moment)--}. {==Edges==}{>>GuG: Eigentlich ist edge eine Kante – wenn nicht spezifischer DH Ausdruck (was ich nicht weiß), würde ich vorschlagen, gebräuchlicheren Terminus zu wählen<<} are drawn between nodes (periodical titles) when one references the other. The thickness of the edges indicates the number of issues that reference a periodical (weight{>>ed degree<<}). The size and colour of nodes reflect the number of journals in our corpus that mention this periodical (in-{==degree==}{>>i.e. the number of edges that connect to a node<<}{--: 3 = red, 2 = blue, 1 = purple--}).

{==The first observation==}{>>GuG: Als advocatus diaboli: Was hiervon ist so überraschend und innovativ, dass es die enorme Investition von Resourcen überzeugend macht? Bei 1 und 2 sagen Sie selber, dass es Erwartungen bestätigt. 3 und 4 ließen sich durch eine traditionelle Lektüre ebenso herausbekommen, und 5 wirft eine Hypothese auf, die digital aber nicht bestätigt werden kann, sondern ebenfalls zu traditionellem Lesen zurückführt. Das heißt keinesfalls, dass Ihr Projekt keinen Sinn macht, aber ich glaube, hier wäre es gut die Argumente zu schärfen.

Till:
Hier muss ich entschieden widersprechen.
- 1.1 ist wichtig, da er die Methode validiert. Wenn das Netzwerk nicht die generellen Eigenschaften von sozialen Netzwerken aufwiese, wäre das ein Indikator dafür, dass es sich nicht um ein soziales Netzwerk handelt, bzw. für Fehler in der Analyse.
- 1.2 bestätigt zwar mit drei Magazinen die gängigen Annahmen über dieses Netzwerk, aber das ist bisher nicht empirisch nachgewiesen worden. Die anderen 6 Magazine im Kern des Netzwerks werden ansonsten eher nicht als zentral erwähnt.
- 2, siehe 1.2. Es bestätigt unsere Annahmen, aber die konkrete Ausprägung ist so noch nicht empirisch belegt worden.
- 3 und 4: Das Argument, dass computergestützte Verfahren nichts qualitativ neues erbringen ist in sofern ein Scheinargument, als dass die konkrete Umsetzung ohne Computer vom Aufwand her in vertretbaren Zeiträumen schlicht nicht erbracht werden kann. Dafür müssten a) alle c. 10000 Seiten mit 2,65 Millionen Worten gelesen und sämtliche Verweise auf Zeitschriftentitel festgehalten werden. b) Die erfassten Zeitschriftentitel müssten in diesem Prozess schon disambiguiert werden. c) für alle 465 Zeitschriftentitel müssten dann Statistiken angelegt werden in welchen Zeitschriften und wievielen Ausgaben und Artikeln sie erwähnt werden. d) die relative Gewichtung all dieser Erwähnungen zueinander müsste dann für jede einzelne der 465 Zeitschriften berechnet werden. Und schließlich müssen diese ganzen Werte dann in eine Graphik übersetzt werden.
- 5: in der überwiegenden Mehrheit der digital humanities ist der Anspruch doch gar nicht das "close reading" zu ersetzen, sondern um neue Verfahren zu ergänzen, die es u.a. erlauben große Datenmengen in relativ kurzer Zeit explorativ zu untersuchen und dabei neue Hypothesen zu generieren bzw. alte auf ihre Validität zu überprüfen. <<}, common to all social networks, is that only a very small number of nodes are of relative importance, as measured by in-degree (number of edges connecting to a node) and weight of the edges connecting nodes. Out of a total of 465 different periodical titles, 421 or c. 90% were referred to by only a single journal. 344 periodicals are only mentioned in a single issue and 335 in a single article. {--[@Fig:network-periodicals-core] shows the 44 core nodes---periodicals that were referenced by more than one journal---in more detail.--}
The core of the network in [@fig:network-periodicals] comprises only 44 periodicals mentioned by more than one journal. Only 9 of those (or 2,13% of all periodicals) were referenced by three journals in our corpus. They are: *al-Manār*, *al-Muqtaṭaf*, *al-Hilāl* and *al-Ḍiyā* from <placeName>Cairo</placeName>, *al-Muqtabas* itself, *al-Mufīd*{>> *al-Mufīd* was published by ʿAbd al-Ghanī al-ʿUraysī<<}, *al-Waṭan* and *al-Ḥaqīqa* from <placeName>Beirut</placeName> and *al-Ḥuqūq* from <placeName>Mt. Lebanon</placeName>{>> Till: 
This fits the standard narrative of important journals, with the exception of al-Mufīd. 
neither *al-Ḍiyāʾ*, *al-Mufīd*, *al-Waṭan* nor *al-Ḥaqīqa* or *al-Ḥuqūq* feature prominently in Ayalon's work<<}.  The centrality of the three Cairene periodicals, *al-Manār*, *al-Muqtaṭaf*, *al-Hilāl*, which were all published by Syrian immigrants, tentatively confirms standard narratives of the Arabic press.[^fn37] {++The remaining six, however, do not figure prominently in scholarly literature.++} If we had the means to construct our own corpus without the severe limitations alluded to above, these would be the journals to digitise. Second, this network is highly centralised in terms of geographic distribution. The 44 core nodes were published in only a handful of {==locations==}{>>Till: Provide information as table?
NO<<}: <placeName>Beirut</placeName> (9), <placeName>Cairo</placeName> (7), <placeName>Baghdad</placeName>, <placeName>Damascus</placeName>, <placeName>Paris</placeName> (3), <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>, <placeName>London</placeName>, <placeName>Mt. Lebanon</placeName>, <placeName>Saida</placeName> and <placeName>Zahle</placeName>{== (1).==}{>>Till: plot this information on a map? how many at which locations?
NO<<}

A third observation of the larger network is that *al-Muqtabas* accounts for the vast majority of references to other periodicals by some orders of magnitude even after we account for *al-Muqtabas* having almost thrice as many issues as either *al-Ḥaqāʾiq* or *Lughat al-ʿArab* ([@tbl:corpus]). If we assume that we haven't missed a significant number of {==references==}{>>since mark-up was done automatically, this seems unlikely<<}, then *al-Muqtabas* was more outward-looking and more involved in larger discourses of the day. Fourth, a closer look at the core nodes in the network reveals that all periodicals were primarily self-referential---indicated by the thickest edges connecting a journal to itself (for the purpose of this visualisation and to prevent circular edges, source and target nodes were separated). Fifth, the core nodes include number of surprises: *al-Jinān* was published by <persName>Butrus al-Bustānī</persName> and later his son <persName>Salīm al-Bustānī</persName> in Beirut between 1876 and 1886. This means that either *al-Jinān* was still relevant for certain discourses long after it ceased publication or that the corpus, spanning the years 1906 until 1918, contains a number of historiographic texts mentioning important {==journals==}{>>GuG: Or perhaps that there was another al-Jinan published which has not been identified/found???

Finally, the group of periodicals mentioned in more than one journal in our corpus comprises a number of foreign titles such as *Le Temps*, *Revue des Revues* and *Revue du Monde Musulman* from <placeName>Paris</placeName> and *The Times* from <placeName>London</placeName>{-- (alTan, mjl0 almjlat, altyms--}{>> GuG: This is one of the informations that would be good to have when first looking at the graphs – add in an agenda?

## Analysis of metadata: Network of authors ##

Sketching a network of periodicals and the references between them is only one part in the endeavour to layout the ideosphere of the late Ottoman Eastern Mediterranean. {==Another is the network of authors==}{>>THIS HAS BEEN DONE AT ANOTHER LOCATION IN THIS ARTCILE

Mention Zemmin's comment on al-ʿAẓm being a core contributor to al-Manār:
Zemmin also calls Rafīq al-ʿAẓm "a core contributor to al-Manar"[@Zemmin+2019, 76] but a quick search in OpenArabicPE reveals that he authored only 13 out of more than 4.300 articles. How does this translate into being a core contributor? 
This could also be contrasted with al-ʿAẓm's contributions to *al-Muqtabas*<<} who published in these periodicals and the geographic distribution of places they wrote {==from==}{>>Other layers of this ideosphere not covered in this short overview but worth exploring are the network of works reviewed and mentioned in our corpus. What was read and written about in Damascus and Baghdad?<<}. Knowing the importance of certain authors for an individual periodical is the basis for mapping the {--social--} network of authors across the late Ottoman {==ideosphere==}{>>these findings would need to be contextualised by traditional intellectual history<<}. 

The aim would be to map a network for the hundreds of journals and newspapers published between <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> and <placeName>Aleppo</placeName>, <placeName>Jaffa</placeName> and <placeName>Basra</placeName>. Such a network analysis, nevertheless, already provides valuable insights with our small corpus of bibliographic metadata. We can currently identify {--only--} a total of 319 named authors within this sample: 139 for *al-Muqtabas*, 103 for *al-Haqāʾiq*, 52 for *Lughat al-ʿArab*, and 42 for *al-Ḥasnāʾ*. Quite a significant number appear only with their initials, particularly in *al-Ḥaqāʾiq*, and---with the exception of *al-Ḥasnāʾ*---all of them were men.

<!-- ![Network of authors with bylines in *al-Ḥaqāʾiq*, *al-Ḥasnāʾ*, *Lughat al-ʿArab* and *al-Muqtabas*](../s3a6afa20/plots/network_oape-p3a6afa20_authors_unimodal-n-size_out-degree_ar.png) -->

The first observation, again, is that only a very small number of nodes (14 of 319) are of relative importance as measured in degree (number of edges connecting to a node) and weight of the edges. In the network plot ([@fig:network-authors]), edges were drawn between all authors who  published in the same periodical. Colours and size of nodes signify the out-degree or the number of journals in our corpus in which an author had bylines. The thickness of the edges is a function of the number of articles carrying the byline of a given author. Nodes of authors who published only in a single journal form dense clusters{-- around that periodical's node--}. These are: *al-Ḥaqāʾiq* to the {==left==}{>>New plot: left<<}, *al-Muqtabas* bottom centre, *Lughat al-ʿArab* top centre, and *al-Ḥasnāʾ* to the{== right==}{>>New plot: right<<}.

A closer look at the central nodes of the network reveals that only one author published in all four journals: <persName>Maʿrūf al-Ruṣāfī</persName> was a famous poet from <placeName>Baghdad</placeName> who mostly authored *qaṣīda*s on current political affairs. He moved to <placeName>Istanbul</placeName> after the Young Turk Revolution, where he worked as an Arabic teacher at the Royal College and at the newspaper *Sabīl al-Rashad*. He was elected MP for <placeName>al-Muthanna</placeName> (Iraq) in 1912 and 1914. After World War I, he became a member of the Arab Scientific Academy, established by <persName>Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī</persName> in Damascus.[^fn39] <persName>al-Ruṣāfī</persName>'s close ties to *al-Muqtabas* and <persName>Kurd ʿAlī</persName> are further evident in the announcement for the publication of a first collection (*dīwān*) of his poems in 1910. There, *al-Muqtabas* claimed that <persName>al-Ruṣāfī</persName> was known {--among some people--} as "the poet of *al-Muqtabas*" and---wrongly---that "more than three quarters [of the *qaṣīda*s therein] had been published in this journal".[^fn40] The publication of <persName>al-Ruṣāfī</persName>'s *qaṣīda*s in so many different periodicals raises an important question regarding the production of periodicals: Did <persName>al-Ruṣāfī</persName> send his *qaṣīda*s to the editors of sometimes far-away periodicals {==unsolicited==}{>>better wording?<<}? Was he invited to contribute? {==Did editors take his texts from other sources==}{>>GuG: dies hier ist in gewisser Weise typisch: verstandlich für fachnahe Leser, aber auch für normale Historiker ohne Nahostvorkenntnisse (dass, z.B., diwan Gedichtband heißt?)
Till: But I did explain the term *dīwān* just c. 6 lines above<<} such as the *dīwān*?[^cf14]

The other 13 central nodes had bylines in only two out of four journals. Only eight of the fourteen authors can be found in international authority files{-- as aggregated in [VIAF (virtual international authority file)](http://viaf.org/)--}, which at least means that they have not authored works catalogued in any of the contributing libraries{-- (which, unsurprisingly, have a bias towards the Global North)--} (see [@tbl:core-authors]). Those for whom we have biographic information (employing more traditional close reading of Arabic prosopographic literature)[^fn41] were on average in their mid-thirties during the years under investigation. There is a {==surprising==}{>>why?<<} number of Iraqis and a notable absence of Syrians from this network of two Damascene journals and one periodical from Beirut and Baghdad each. Among the eleven identifiable authors, there are six Iraqis: <persName>Maʿrūf al-Ruṣāfī</persName>, <persName>Kāẓim al-Dujaylī</persName>, <persName>Ibrahīm Ḥilmī al-ʿAmr</persName>, <persName>Anastās Mārī al-Karmalī</persName> (often writing under the pen name Sātisnā), and the two brothers <persName>Muḥammad Riḍā al-Shabībī</persName> and <persName>Muḥammad Bāqir al-Shabībī</persName>; three Egyptians: <persName>Muṣṭafā Ṣādiq al-Rāfiʿī</persName>, <persName>Aḥmad Muḥarram</persName> and <persName>Walī al-Dīn Yakan</persName>; and only two Syrians <persName>ʿĪsā Iskandar al-Maʿlūf</persName> and <persName>Muḥammad Rāghib Ṭabbākh</persName>. One would expect Syrians to figure much more prominently since the vast majority of articles was actually published in Damascus. In addition, Iraqis are much less prominent in the scholarly literature on the Arab renaissance (*nahḍa*) as one would expect from looking at this network. The religious composition of this core group raises the same issue: The ratio of two Christians among a group of 14 is a mirror of the larger populations but surprising if one considers the emphasis on the importance of Christians for the *nahḍa*{== in scholarly literature.==}{>>do I need this? Well there is an argument as to the dominance of Christian Arabs in the *nahḍa*.<<} It also important to note that Ami Ayalon, in his {==quasi standard account of the Arabic press==}{>>GuG: Ist er wirklich noch so unumstritten, wie in diesem Artikel der Anschein erweckt wird?
Till: Ich kenne jedenfalls keine Publikation, die die Nachfolge beanspruchen (könnten).

Table: Authors who published in more than one journal in our corpus comprising *al-Ḥaqāʾiq*, *al-Ḥasnāʾ*, *Lughat al-ʿArab*, and *al-Muqtabas*. {#tbl:core-authors}

In terms of education and occupations the core nodes are exemplary for the bourgeois middle-class intelligentsia of their {==time==}{>>add footnote on the loaded nature of these terms<<}: many attended Ottoman state schools in addition to more traditional, religious venues of education; many knew foreign languages in addition to Arabic and Ottoman; some were trained or even taught abroad in the colonial centres of Paris and London; some served in the Ottoman bureaucracy; some were {==educators==}{>>It would be interesting to track further connections between the core nodes, such as shared education, membership in institutions, collaborations etc. using information mined from prosopographical literature.

There is also a significant number of poets (7) among the central nodes[^fn43] and a small number of{== politicians (MPs).==}{>>This is quite close to Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī's description of the requirements for being a journalist (ṣaḥāfī).

Looking at the latter, the importance of *al-Muqtabas* in this small network (and beyond) cannot be overstated: <persName>al-Karmalī</persName> signed more articles in *al-Muqtabas* than his own journal *Lughat al-ʿArab*. The connection to <placeName>Damascus</placeName> and <persName>Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī</persName> is further evident in four of the central nodes becoming members of the Arab Scientific Academy in Damascus after World War I, whose first president was <persName>Kurd ʿAlī</persName> himself.[^fn44] 

Another striking observation can be found in the proximity and overlap of clusters. Two of the journals in our corpus, *al-Muqtabas* and *al-Ḥaqāʾiq*, were predominantly published in the same city but there is only very limited overlap. Their clusters are only losely connected by {==a handful of people==}{>>6<<} who have only one or two bylines in each journal. The ties between <placeName>Cairo</placeName>, <placeName>Damascus</placeName> and <placeName>Baghdad</placeName> as signified by *al-Muqtabas* and *Lughat al-ʿArab*, on the other hand, being much closer. The number of shared authors is only {==marginally bigger==}{>>7<<} but they had many more bylines to their names. This contradicts the assumption that due to the very small size of local journalistic circles---in 1912, five monthly journals were published in Damascus and none had a print run of more than a few hundred copies[^fn45]---there would be a substantial overlap in authorship between periodicals from the same provincial city.

### Individual periodicals ###

The work on compiling the biographies of all 319 currently identifiable contributors is far from being done, but after looking at the most productive authors for each journal, we can identify certain trends in the author populations and their geographic distributions. For the purpose of this essay, I will contrast *al-Muqtabas* and *al-Ḥaqāʾiq*, the two Damascene periodicals in our corpus.

Only 50 authors published more than one article in *al-Muqtabas*. Two of the five most prolific authors with more than ten bylines to their names wrote from <placeName>Baghdad</placeName> ([@tbl:authors-muqtabas]): <persName>Maʿrūf al-Ruṣāfī</persName> and <persName>Anastās Mārī al-Karmalī</persName>{--, using the pen name Sātisnā--}{>> GuG: I do not think this needs to be repeated each time<<}. <persName>ʿĪsā Iskandar al-Maʿlūf</persName> wrote mostly from <placeName>Zaḥle</placeName> and <persName>Yūsuf Jirjis Zakham</persName> from <placeName>Omaha</placeName> and <placeName>Lincoln</placeName>, <placeName>Nebraska</placeName>, <placeName>USA</placeName>. {==Only the fifth most prolific author was a native resident of Damascus==}{>>GuG: Could it be that he published very much without being named???

Table: The 15 most prolific authors in *al-Muqtabas* by number of articles (7 or more). {#tbl:authors-muqtabas}

The four men out of the five, for whom we can find biographical records, are in many aspects exemplary of the modernising late Ottoman Empire and the Middle East: Coming from a plurality of religious and social backgrounds---Greek Orthodox, Catholic and Sunnī Muslim, priest and leading Salafi thinker of the second generation, part-time officials, of simple means and members of the old elites---they belonged to the same generation (born between the mid-1860s and mid-1870s) and worked as journalists, teachers, and occasionally politicians. All of them were highly mobile and well-travelled and had good command of local as well as foreign languages---to the extent that some of them published literary translations. The fifth man is not less exemplary, even though his story seems to be rather uncommon among journalists: <persName>Yūsuf Jirjis Zakham</persName> was one of the many emigrants from Greater Syria to America. He arrived in the USA in 1902 and was naturalised in 1904, settled in Lincoln, Nebraska, where he married Myra from Iowa and had at least five children. Both spouses were literate and Joseph George Zakem provided his profession as newspaper correspondent in the 1910 US Federal Census.[^fn46]

The geographic distribution and relative frequencies of locations mentioned in bylines conveys the same image as the network of referenced periodicals and the brief comments on the most prolific authors' biographies: *al-Muqtabas* was a publication of at least regional importance. It reached well beyond Greater Syria to Egypt, Iraq and even America, turning the famous proverb "Cairo writes, Beirut publishes and Baghdad reads" upside down with Baghdad well ahead of even Damascus.[^fn47]

The picture is different for *al-Ḥaqāʾiq* ([@tbl:authors-haqaiq]), which was repeatedly in conflict with *al-Muqtabas* over the latter's supposed moral laxity. Its most prolific contributors were Damascene Sunni religious scholars from notable families, many of whom were at least one generation older than its opponents (the average year of birth for *al-Ḥaqāʾiq* is 1837 and 1869 for *al-Muqtabas*). Among them are <persName>Ibrāhīm Mardam Bek</persName>, <persName>Muḥammad ʿĀrif al-Munīr al-Ḥusaynī</persName> (b.1847/48), <persName>Mukhtār al-Muʾayyad</persName> (b.1822) and <persName>Muḥammad al-Qāsimī</persName> (b.1843), whose son <persName>Jamāl al-Dīn al-Qāsimī</persName> was among *al-Muqtabas*' contributors. The initially surprising finding of very limited overlap between the two networks of authors published in journals from the same city, becomes less so against this backdrop. Looking at the top 14 contributors to both journals, we can also note that whereas only two authors from *al-Muqtabas* are missing from VIAF and thus international library catalogues, the same is true for eight of al-*Ḥaqāʾiq*'s most frequent {==authors==}{>>This further affirms the difference between a journal with transregional impact and a more parochial periodical<<} ([@tbl:authors-haqaiq; @tbl:authors-muqtabas]).

Table: The 14 most prolific authors in *al-Ḥaqāʾiq* by number of bylines. {#tbl:authors-haqaiq}

A map of the relative frequency of locations mentioned in bylines confirms the brief overview of the authors' biographies---*al-Ḥaqā'iq* was a parochial paper with a focus on local issues. Its geographic network was mainly restricted to Damascus itself and the cities of the Syrian hinterland. Similarly distinctly regional distributions of authorship can be established for one of the two remain periodicals in our corpus: *al-Ḥasnāʾ*. *Lughat al-ʿArab*, on the other hand, only rarely provided locations in bylines (26 of 939 articles), which doesn't allow for meaningful observations.[^fn48]

# Authorship attribution #

It is worth going back to the bibliographic {--meta--}data, its shortcomings and the resulting consequences for our analysis. We are particularly concerned with the number of articles that carried bylines or otherwise easily identifiable authorship information.[^fn49] All journals in our corpus, like any other periodical at the time I have seen, published only limited authorship information. {--In this regard al-Ḥaqāʾiq is the least offending--}{>> GuG: rephrase<<}{-- ([@tbl:corpus]).--} About 42% of all articles in *al-Ḥaqāʾiq*{-- (163 of 389)--} carried authorship information ([@tbl:corpus]). Second is *al-Ḥasnāʾ* with 36% {--(63 of 173)--}, followed by *Lughat al-ʿArab* with 16% {--(152 of 939)--} and *al-Muqtabas* with not even 13% {--(377 of 2964)--}. {--The picture becomes more favourable for the latter if we look only at longer articles. About two fifths of articles outside news and review sections explicitly mentioned an author. However, i--}{++In++} consequence and due to the heavy weight of *al-Muqtabas* in our corpus, {--this means that--} we can only map 16,91% of the entire network of articles by looking at explicit bibliographic information alone. {==More than four fifths are hidden from our view.==} 

Surprisingly the question of authorship has not received much attention.[^fn50] The, often implicit and accepted, hypothesis is that periodical editors authored all articles for which they did not provide a meaningful byline themselves.[^fn51]

This {--hypothesis--} raises a number of problems and considerations. Most importantly, the hypothesis remains untested. Second, we simply do not know enough about any given periodical to even name all {--formal collaborators --}{++editors++}. Cover pages of journals and mastheads of newspapers had a limited vocabulary to state responsibilities for an issue, not all of which were always provided: *owner* or *concessionary* (*ṣāḥib*, *ṣāḥib al-imtiyāz*), *responsible director* (*al-mudīr al-masʾūl*) and *editor-in-chief* (*raʾis al-taḥrīr*).[^cf16] Commonly these functions converged and periodicals provided only a single name. Third, it is highly unlikely that a single person authored and edited almost the complete content of a periodical in addition to operating the whole business of {--printing, distribution, acquisitions of adverts --}{++publishing++}. Some owners-cum-editors ran more than one periodical. <persName>Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī</persName>, for instance, published a daily {--of four pages --}{++newspaper++} in addition to his monthly journal. We must therefore conceptualise potential authorship by editors as a collaborative {>>or communal<<} endeavour. Fourth, owner-cum-editors were repeatedly absent from the place of publication and printing and it is hard to believe they would have run their periodicals via the telegraph. Either a periodical suspended publication during their absence or it must have been produced by someone else in their stead.[^fn52] In the case of *al-Muqtabas*, we know that {--Muḥammad--} <persName>Kurd ʿAlī</persName> fled <placeName>Damascus</placeName> and the Ottoman Empire twice for extended periods of time due to conflicts {--of his newspaper --}{>>al-Muqtabas<<} with the {==censors==}{>>authorities<<}. During his newspaper's suspensions between September 1909 and March 1910 and between April and August 1912, <persName>Kurd ʿAlī</persName> fled to Egypt and then travelled through Europe. His {++travelogues++} {--letters about his observations--} were serialised in his periodicals as *gharāʾib al-gharb* (Oddities of the West) and *fī diyār al-gharb* (In the countries of the West) and later published in book form. The consequence of his absences on his potential authorship for articles in *al-Muqtabas* is not entirely clear. This is partially due to the difficulty of establishing actual publication dates as alluded to above. In 1909/10 the publication frequency of *al-Muqtabas* corresponded with <persName>Kurd ʿAlī</persName>'s absence from Damascus,[^cf17] while during the latter period, the publication {--of the final seven issues of volume seven --}of *al-Muqtabas* moved to {==Cairo==}{>>how did they do that?<<}---yet, <persName>Kurd ʿAlī</persName> was travelling through Europe and can therefore not be assumed as the main editor.[^fn53]

On a more empirical level, we can find repeated calls from multiple periodicals on authors of anonymously submitted contributions to come forward and provide their identities to the publishers.[^fn54] In a similar vein, the newspaper *al-Muqtabas* rejected allegations that articles published by pseudonymous authors were indeed authored by the editors.[^fn55]

{--What are the computational means for casting some light on the more than four fifths of articles without authorship information and to test the hypothesis that editors were indeed the authors of unattributed texts?--} (Computational) stylistics or stylometry is a common and established approach in linguistics and literary studies {++for authorship attribution and genre detection. It is based++} the observation "that authors tend to write in relatively consistent, recognizable and unique ways", which is particularly true for an author's {==choice of words==}{>>But here, "vocabulary" should not be reduced to Lexikalität⁠<<}.[^fn56] In the context of stylometry, {=="style" commonly means a frequency count of words==}{>>GuG: 
1. Gibt es keine Genre Varianz zwischen den verschiedenen Artikeln, die ein unterschiedliches Vokabular viel eher erklären würden, als die Unterschiede zwischen den Autoren?
2. Nochmals die Frage nach dem Shelf life eines Artikels – hat sich in dieser Hinsicht seit 2009 so wenig getan, dass keine neuen digitalen Tools bereitgestellt wurden?
Till:

- zu 2: Das angeführte Werk von Koppel ist eine Einführung und Übersicht über Theorien und Methoden und nicht über konkrete Werkzeuge zur Umsetzung von Methoden. Letzteres würde in der Tat schneller veralten.<<} used in a given text.[^fn57] Stylometry then computes degrees of similarity between texts, called distance measure, through comparing multivariant frequency lists of textual features. The important catch is that stylometry is a comparative method. In order to establish similarities one has to have access to a significant corpus of digital texts by authors likely to be found among the unattributed texts. If we only compare every article in our periodical corpus to every other article in the same corpus, we cannot possibly identify any author not yet named in a byline. Instead, the best we could hope for would be to establish groups of texts that have a certain likelihood of having been authored by the same person.

The present essay is the first foray into stylometric authorship attribution for Arabic periodicals. {--Christiane--} Czygan's work is the only attempt at stylometric authorship attribution for Ottoman periodicals I have come across, but, after developing a set of style markers for individual editors-cum-authors, the author did not apply them for actual authorship attribution.[^fn58]

There is some debate as to which style-markers and distance measure should be considered for authorship attribution, but I settled on {--lists of--} Most Frequent Words (MFW) and Burrows' Delta{--, which can be visualised as dendrograms--}.[^fn59] {--All stylometric analysis--}{>> GuG: Auch auf die Gefahr hin, dass ein langer Artikel noch länger wird: ich glaube, hier setzen Sie zu viel DH Kompetenz beim Leser voraus, sowohl im Vokabular als auch in dem, was verschiedene Programme leisten können.<<}{-- was done using the "stylo()" package for R--}{>> [@Eder+2016b]. R is a widely used free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.<<}{-- on plain-text versions of our corpus--}{>> Plain text, here, means that everything but the actual textual content, including mark-up, metadata and structural information, was computationally removed.<<}{--.--} Texts were not pre-processed by{--, for instance,--} morphologising or lemmatizing, as this would reduce the authorship signal to the vocabulary used. Similarly, function words, which, by definition, are the most frequent words, were not removed. Their frequency is independent of a text's topic and it is unlikely that an author can consciously control this frequency.[^fn60]

{++Because the number of MFW has a significant impact on the results,++}{-- Maciej --}Eder{--, inspired by phylogenetics,--} suggested to use {--bootstrap consensus trees and--} *consensus networks* in order to separate signal and noise{-- and in order to overcome selection bias when picking from a range of dendrograms--}{==.==}{>>GuG: ditto<<} {--In the latter method,--}{++ To this end, ++}one computes the nearest neighbour as well as the first two runners-up for a sequence of MFW (e.g. from 100 to 1000 MFW in increments of 100) and then combines the results in a single output, which serves as a form of self-validation for the more robust signals. The results can then be visualised using network analysis.[^fn61]

Finally, there is an important caveat in applying stylometry to periodicals: Eder experimentally established a threshold length of 5000 words as the minimal required length of a text for meaningful attribution{-- using medium-sized corpora of prose texts in English, Polish, German, Hungarian, Latin and Greek and applying Burrows' Delta on 200 MFW--}. Below 5000 words, the signal was "immensely affected by random noise".[^cf18] These findings have severe implications---most texts in our corpus are much shorter than 5000 words and even the longer ones are too short for random sampling. Nevertheless, limiting our experiments with stylometric analysis to the some fifty articles of more than 5000 words yielded promising results and shows at least three distinct signals: genre, author and translator/editor.[^fn62]

Our initial analysis of all articles of 5000 words and more using bootstrap {++networks++} {--consensus trees--} for 100--1000 MFWs confirms the general applicability of stylometry to our corpus ([@fig:stylometry]). Articles form clusters based on edge weight and {==modularity==}{>>number of edges among members higher than to other clusters<<} around authors, editors and translators. Thus, we find clusters of articles authored by <persName>Jamāl al-Dīn al-Qāsimī</persName>, <persName>Aḥmad Zakī</persName>, <persName>Charles Seignobos</persName>, and <persName>Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī</persName>. The latter was the translator of Seignobos's works from French, which is clearly visible in the close proximity between clusters of works by both authors{-- on the right of the plot--}. A similar relation{-- appears on the left of the plot, where one--} can be observed in the proximity between clusters of works authored by <persName>Jamāl al-Dīn al-Qāsimī</persName> {--(dark green)--} and classic texts he {--discovered and--} edited and commented on{-- (pink)--}. In general, the network analysis shows only limited stylistic {==overlap==}{>>in terms of modularity and edge weights<<} between authors and we can assume with a high degree of confidence that the cluster of anonymous articles {--in light green--} on the {==bottom right==} was authored by <persName>Kurd ʿAlī</persName>. Since the sample contains almost exclusively articles from *al-Muqtabas*, this would tentatively confirm the authorship hypothesis of editors. However, there is also a cluster of non-attributed articles in the centre between<persName> al-Qāsimī</persName>'s and<persName> Zakī</persName>'s that are stylistically distinct and far removed from <persName>Kurd ʿAlī</persName>'s texts. This contradicts the hypothesis and points to another, unknown author.

Furthermore, the plot also shows a strong signal of genre: the cluster of unattributed texts most likely written by <persName>Kurd ʿAlī</persName> are all geographic works.

# Conclusion #

In this essay, I questioned hyperbolic promises of ubiquitous digitised knowledge from the marginal position of Middle Eastern intellectual history and by outlining the techno-infrastructural challenges faced by a {=="digital history"==}{>>or computational approaches to the material artefacts<<} of societies outside the Global North. I showed, how a digital episteme deeply rooted in 20th-century, english-speaking{--, American neoliberal--} capitalism requires mitigation strategies on every level of the digital workflow. These are placed on the individual scholar and involve significant investments in the making of corpora, resources and tools if we want to reap the promised fruits of the digital humanities. {==I also posed that one of the consequences of this episteme is a neo-colonial silencing of the material heritage of the societies in the Eastern Mediterranean.==}{>>Till: tone it down<<}

Nevertheless, digital corpora and computational approaches are indispensable for scrutinising the periodical press as an ideosphere. I argued that one has to transcend the individual periodical and engage in a systematic study of the periodical press at scale in order to better understand both the intellectual history of the Eastern Mediterranean and periodical production itself. The case study of a corpus of four late Ottoman Arabic-speaking periodicals from the Eastern Mediterranean (*al-Muqtabas*, *al-Ḥaqaʾiq*, *Lughat al-ʿArab*, and *al-Ḥasnāʾ*) introduced and evaluated some of the mitigation strategies. After introducing my own efforts of building an open and scholarly digital corpus, I engaged in computational exploration through network analysis, {==mapping==}{>>Till: cut? I only briefly commented on geographic distribution<<}, and stylometry along the guiding question of what were the core nodes (authors and periodicals) in the ideoscape of the late Ottoman Eastern Mediterranean?

{>>The paper also presents the first application of methods of distant reading to the study of late Ottoman Arabic periodicals.<<}

Modelling the network of references to periodical titles, I could confirm established knowledge about the importance of certain journals over others. The Cairene journals of *al-Manār*, *al-Muqtaṭaf* and *al-Hilāl* were indeed central to the late Ottoman Arabic ideosphere, even though they were published outside the Ottoman {==Empire==}{>>Egypt is de facto independent of the Ottoman Empire<<}. A future systematic exploration of periodicals will have to digitise these and compare them to *al-Muqtabas*, which shows many traits of a periodical of transregional importance very different from the other journals in our corpus.

The exploration of the network of article authors{-- published in our corpus--}, on the other hand, provided a number of surprising results that will need to be addressed in future scholarship: The noted importance of Iraqi writers over Syrians among the core nodes of the network contradicts the common narrative about the Arabic renaissance (*nahḍa*). A similar importance of <placeName>Baghdad</placeName> over the more commonly assumed centres of Arab intellectual production is found in the geographic distribution of toponyms in bylines for *al-Muqtabas*. One would, again, need to test other transregional periodicals to see whether they provide a similar Iraqi connection or if *al-Muqtabas* is an outlier in this regard. The network analysis of authors also demonstrated lacunae in the historiography of the Arabic press and the intellectual history of the late Ottoman Arab ideosphere, namely the absence of the core nodes in our network from major works of scholarship.

Any analysis of authorship and socio-intellectual networks is limited by the fact that less than one fifth of all articles carry identifiable authorship information. I, therefore, presented a first empirical analysis of the common but untested hypothesis that editors authored the four fifths of anonymous articles themselves by submitting our corpus to stylometric authorship attribution. This provided significant hints towards authors of  articles longer than 5000 words. Although we cannot (yet) assign a specific name, the analysis of articles {--of more than 5000 words in--}{++ from++} *al-Muqtabas* returned one cluster of texts by an anonymous author very different from those articles that can indeed by attributed to the editor Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī.

The de-contextualising of strings of text from the page and the wider context of the periodical immanent to keyword search has been repeatedly criticised as inadequate for the study of periodicals; [e.g. {--@Brake+2012a; --}@Brake+2012, 17; @Bingham+2010, 229--230; @Gooding+2018, 12--13].

[^cf3]: The validity of this statement, of course, depends on the purpose of digitisation. If one was, for instance, interested in distant reading approaches to large corpora, such as the temporal distribution of certain keywords during a long print run, this would allow not just for aggregation on the issue level but probably even periods of full months and more. In consequence, error margins of almost one fourth in both Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER) become seemingly acceptable; [e.g. @Cristianini+2018, 144]. {--Ryan Cordell argues for the importance of theorising the impact of OCR on scholarly findings.

[No. 4(7)](https://tillgrallert.github.io/digital-muqtabas/xml/oclc_4770057679-i_42.TEIP5.xml) was scheduled for Rajab 1327 aH (July/August 1909) according to its masthead, but only published in the first week of April the following year; see [@muqtabas+76-eap, 3]. {--al-Ḥaqāʾiq is more difficult to date through external sources because unlike al-Muqtabas it was only rarely mentioned in other publications. However, a prolonged dispute with the newspaper al-Muqtabas in 1911 provides some clues. [al-Ḥaqāʾiq 1(12):476](https://openarabicpe.github.io/digital-haqaiq/xml/oclc_644997575-i_12.TEIP5.xml#pb_64.d1e1562){haqaiq i:12@476} referenced [@muqtabas+288-eap]. Therefore, it must have been published at least 10 days after the publication date provided by the masthead.--}

[^cf8]: Both Weber and Hanssen, for instance, missed the fact that the birthday of Sultan <persName>ʿAbdülḥamīd II</persName> (1876--1909) was celebrated according to the Islamic *hijrī* calendar and thus rotated through the solar year. The annual celebrations of the anniversary of the <persName>ʿAbdülḥamīd II</persName>'s accession to the throne were celebrated according to the empire's *mālī* calendar. Yet, leading scholars read these dates as pertaining to the *hijrī* calendar. Due to {--the --}{++a++} mix-up in 1872 and the resulting growing difference between the two calendars, <persName>ʿAbdülḥamīd II</persName>'s silver jubilee on the throne is wrongly dated to 1901 instead of 1900. [@Hanssen+2005, 238, 243ff.;@Weber+2009, 418--420; @Deringil+1998, 29; @Uluengin+2010, 20].

[^cf9]: Consider, for instance, {--the quasi standard for digital scholarly editions,--} the family of XML technologies. According to the XPath specifications, the [`format-date()`](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions-30/#func-format-date) function supports a number calendars beyond the Gregorian standard, including the Islamic *hijrī* calendar, since version 2.0. However, the actual support for calendars and languages is implementation-dependent and Saxon, the main XSLT, XPath and XQuery processor, has not implemented any of these alternative calendars; see [documentation for `format-dateTime()`](https://www.saxonica.com/html/documentation/functions/fn/format-dateTime.html).

[^cf15]: The article count for <persName>Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī</persName> depends on the definition of an "article" and wether we include texts without byline but whose authorship can be established without doubt. If we count each section in his series *gharāʾib al-gharb* and *fī diyār al-gharb* as independent article (they were originally published as letters in the newspaper *al-Muqtabas*), his article count would significantly spike.

[^fn49]: In addition to intrinsic bibliographic information, such as bylines and footnotes, I also explicitly encoded extrinsic information on authorship. Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī, for instance, is well known to be the author of a series of letters titled *Gharāʾib al-Gharb* (Oddities of the West). The gathering and encoding of extrinsic information cannot considered systematic or comprehensive at this point.

[^fn50]: The problem is not even mentioned in [@Ayalon+1995].

[^fn51]: For examples of this implicit hypothesis see [@Seikaly+1981, 130, 131], where he assigns a number of anonymous articles in *al-Muqtabas* to Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī without even discussing his assumption. [@Czygan+2012, 120] makes the same assumption by stating that it wasn't entirely clear if Ḍiyā Bey authored the final 36 issues of the journal *Ḥürriyet* all by himself.
